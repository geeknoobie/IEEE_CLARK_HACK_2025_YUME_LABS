The Office of Global Engagement assists Clark faculty and staff who are interested in setting up agreements with an international entity. All international agreements must be signed by the provost or his/her designee. If you are interested in developing a new international partnership, please contact the associate dean for international programs, who can provide an overview of the process and answer any questions you might have. To view all of the active agreements Clark currently has or to propose a new program, please visit our Partnerships Page. Immigration Resources The International Students and Scholars Office (ISSO) works with Clark departments to facilitate the immigration process for international faculty, researchers and visiting scholars. Departments are responsible for facilitating the immigration sponsorship process for new hires and research appointments. Please contact the ISSO as quickly as possible to ensure a smooth visa process for your new department member. The ISSO also advises on payments and honoraria to international guests for lectures or other services provided to the University. Contact ISSO Director Amanda Desai with any immigration questions about hiring an international faculty member or researcher or inviting a short-term visitor. Permanent Resident Sponsorship Policy In general, Clark University will sponsor all tenured and tenure-track faculty for permanent residency. The International Students and Scholars Office (ISSO) works with departments, faculty, and their families on a case-by-case basis. Please note that the ISSO will typically pursue a short-term immigration solution such a J-1 or H1-B visa before initiating the permanent residency process. Visa Options for International Employees (Faculty and Researchers) The International Students and Scholars Office (ISSO) takes a variety of factors into consideration when making a determination regarding the most appropriate visa category for international faculty and researchers employed by Clark. The most common visa categories for this population are indicated below: J-1 Research Scholar or Professor: The J-1 visa program is a U.S. Department of State exchange visitor program. J-1 status is often used for postdoctoral fellows. J-1 status cannot be used for a candidate for a tenured or tenure track position. H1-B Temporary Worker: The H1-B visa program is a nonimmigrant classification for individuals performing services in a specialty occupation managed by (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services USCIS). H1-B status is granted for an initial period of up to three years with the possibility of extension for another three years. This is the status that Clark will pursue for tenured or tenure-track faculty. Visa Options for International Visiting Scholars Clark also sponsors researchers and visiting scholars who are not employed by Clark University but have an academic appointment that provides access to privileges such as working with specific faculty, a department, and/or a research center or institute and access to Clark facilities. Before the ISSO can process any visa documents for a visiting scholar, the department needs to obtain an appointment letter from the Provost’s Office. Please note that international scholars who are unpaid by Clark and are visiting for more than six months will be required to pay a $200 international scholar fee upon arrival unless the scholar is receiving funding from Clark University. Department Sponsorship Process The ISSO uses the ISSO Portal to facilitate the visa sponsorship and document issuances process. Each department at Clark has been assigned a department administrator with access to the ISSO Portal. Contact the ISSO if you are not sure who the departmental contact is for the ISSO Portal in your department. Department hires a new international employee or receives approval for a visiting scholar. Department admin submits a sponsorship request in the ISSO Portal. The ISSO reviews the request and makes a determination regarding which visa category is most appropriate. Depart administrator completes a department intake form in the ISSO Portal and uploads an appointment letter. ISSO contacts the international employee or scholar to submit additional information and documentation. If eligible, the ISSO will either issue a DS-2019 for the J-1 visa category or submit a petition to USCIS for an H-1B. In some cases, other visa categories will be used. The employee or visiting scholar may not begin their appointment until they are in receipt of all required immigration documents and approvals. International Short-Term Visitors to Clark University International visitors to Clark University for short-term business or pleasure will need to seek a B Visa or a waiver under the Visa Waiver Program to travel to the U.S. B-visa The B-1 Visa for a visitor coming to the U.S. for short-term business, such as to participate in scientific, educational, professional, or business conventions, conferences, or seminars. The B-2 Visa is for a visitor coming to the U.S. for pleasure/tourism or medical treatment. The B Visa is not appropriate for students or long-term scholars coming to Clark University, for anyone coming to Clark University for purposes of employment, for students engaging in formal study in a credit-bearing program, or for anyone coming to Clark University to engage in collaborative research or as primary investigators. Visitors should contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in their country for information on the visa application and processing time. A letter of invitation from Clark University may be helpful and can be requested by following the process outlined below. Visa Waiver Program Citizens from a limited number of countries are permitted to visit the U.S. for up to 90 days without a B-1 or B-2 visa under the Visa Waiver Program. Visitors coming to the U.S. for short-term business are admitted in WB status and visitors coming to the U.S. for pleasure are admitted in WT status. Certain requirements apply under the Visa Waiver Program, including passport requirements, pre-screening clearance authorization called ESTA, and evidence of ESTA approval. Time in the U.S. Entry into the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program generally limited to a non-extendable maximum stay of 90 days, or six months under the B-1/B-2 Visa status. Stays may also be limited to the expected duration of the visit. Employment in the U.S. Employment and/or per diem payments are not permitted on the B Visa or under the Visa Waiver Program. A B-1 visitor (and by extension visitors on the Visa Waiver Program) may receive reimbursement for travel and living expenses. A B-1 visitor (and by extension visitors on the Visa Waiver Program) may also be paid an honorarium for “usual academic activities,” as long as the academic activity does not last longer than 9 days at any institution and the visitor has not accepted similar payments from more than 5 institutions during the previous 6 months (this is known as the 9/5/6/ Rule). “Usual academic activities” at Clark University include lecturing, teaching and share of knowledge, or performance (when the performance if composed of non-paying students and/or is open to the general public for free). The U.S. Internal Revenue Service considers all honorarium payments to be taxable income and requires that Clark, as the paying agent, withhold at a 30% rate. Due to requirements of both the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), processing honorarium payments takes time. Please note that honorarium rules are different for B Visa holders and other visa holders (such as J-1 or H1-B). To confirm if Clark University can reimburse a visitor for travel and living expenses, or pay an honorarium for usual academic activities, please view the full process here. Questions regarding visas and compensation based on visa category can be directed to the ISSO Director (Amanda Desai- Adesai@clarku.edu). Please note that the ISSO cannot advise on taxation of payments made to guests. Please contact Accounts Payable for all taxation questions.

International Student Welcome Obtain Your Visa Document To come to Clark to study, work, or conduct research, you will need a visa document from the International Students and Scholars Office (ISSO). This document (I-20, DS-2019) will allow you to apply for a visa and enter the United States in your intended visa category. Important terms and steps for obtaining your visa document are discussed below. Important Terms Visa Document The ISSO issues two different kinds of visa documents (or “certificates of eligibility”) to students: Form I-20 for F-1 students Form DS-2019 for J-1 students. Visa A visa is a form that is glued or stamped in your passport by a U.S. consulate outside the United States. You need a visa to request permission to enter the United States for a particular reason, such as full-time study. Even if you already have another U.S. visa such as a B-1/B-2 visitor visa, you need an F-1 or J-1 visa to study full-time at a university. Canadian Citizens: If you are a citizen of Canada, you will typically not need a visa to enter the U.S. However, you will need a Form DS-2019 or I-20 from the ISSO, and all rules for maintaining lawful status in the U.S. during your stay still apply. Duration of Status F-1 and J-1 students are admitted to the United States for duration of status. As Study in the States explains: “As an international student in the United States, you have a certain amount of time to arrive in the country, complete your studies, and return to your home country. Understanding the length of time you are permitted to be in the United States is a very important part of maintaining your status. When you arrive at a U.S. port of entry, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer will provide you with an admission stamp that will list the date in which you must depart the United States. As an F-1 student, you will most likely have duration of status (D/S) listed on your admission stamp. D/S means you may remain in the United States so long as you maintain your nonimmigrant student status.” Please refer to ISSO guidance for maintaining your valid F-1 or J-1 status. F-1 Status Most international students come to the U.S. in F-1 student status. If you have been accepted to a full-time undergraduate and graduate program, certificate, or English-language programs, Clark University will sponsor your F-1 visas status. F-1 students cannot study part time. F-1 students are permitted to bring a spouse and unmarried minor child under 21 with them on F-2 dependent visas. You will need to demonstrate that you have sufficient resources to support your dependents during your stay. You can find more information on work and study rules for F-2 dependents here. J-1 Status In some cases, students may be eligible for J-1 student status. The ISSO will make a determination regarding the most appropriate visa category for you after you complete the International Student Form in Clark’s application system. The J-1 student category is part of the U.S. Department of State Exchange Visitor Program and has strict rules about who qualifies for this visa category. The J-1 category is designated for exchange visitors, recipients of U.S. or home country scholarships requiring J-1 status, and students who are receiving most of their funding from a government, university, or other non-personal or family source. J-1 students are permitted to bring a spouse and unmarried minor child under 21 with them on J-2 dependent visas. You will need to demonstrate that you have sufficient resources to support your dependents during your stay. You can find more information on work and study rules for J-2 dependents here. Student Visa Document (I-20 and DS-2019) Process To qualify for a Form I-20 or DS-2019 from Clark, you must receive an offer of admission and pay your enrollment deposit confirming your plans to attend Clark. Please check with your admissions counselor for more information on the process to submit your deposit and any important deadlines. Please read through this information carefully. Failure to submit the correct documents in a timely fashion could delay the issuance of your I-20 or DS-2019. Visa Document Instructions After you pay your enrollment deposit, you will receive an email with instructions on how to initiate a request for your student visa document through the ISSO Portal. Please pay attention to any deadlines in order to receive your documents in time to apply for a student visa. Students Currently Enrolled at Another Institution with Valid F-1/J-1 Student Status If you are currently enrolled at another school in the U.S. with F-1 or J-1 student status and have a valid Form I-20 or DS-2019, you may be eligible to transfer your student status to Clark. When setting up your profile on the ISSO portal, complete the “Transfer In” request to facilitate the transfer of your student record from your previous school. Preparing your Financial Documentation You are required to demonstrate that you have enough financial resources to cover the estimated costs for your first academic year of study. These costs include tuition, fees, health insurance, living expenses, and support for any dependents who are coming with you. While you are only required to show that you have financial resources for one academic year, it is essential that you plan your finances carefully for the duration of your program. Obtaining additional funding after your arrival is not guaranteed. It may be very difficult to secure on-campus employment, financial aid, or additional scholarships. Review the estimated costs for your program Documents must be less than six months old. Documents must be issued in English or accompanied by an English translation. The ISSO reserves the right to request any submitted document, such as a bank statement, to be officially translated into English. If you are submitting a bank account statement that is NOT in your name, your sponsor must complete the Affidavit of Support. Acceptable documentation: Personal or family bank statement Scholarship letter(s) from government sources, your Clark department, or other scholarship-granting agencies, clearly indicating your name, scholarship year or dates, and covered amounts Approved loan confirmation Documents that will not be accepted: Income tax or salary statements Property deeds or rental agreements Investment or stock portfolios Promissory notes Lines of credit from credit cards Statements from chartered accountants Other statements regarding assets that are not available in liquid cash amounts Visiting Scholar Visa Document Process Visiting scholars are invited to conduct research and engage in other academic pursuits at Clark University. You must have an invitation from a Clark department. You will not be considered an employee of Clark and will not receive any employee benefits. Typically, visiting scholars have an affiliation with an international university and are self-funded and self-guided in their research activities. Visiting scholars who need visas to come to the U.S. will be sponsored by Clark as J-1 exchange visitors, in either the J-1 research scholar or J-1 short-term scholar category. These visa categories are part of the U.S. Department of State exchange programs. Once Clark has agreed to sponsor you as a J-1 visiting scholar, you will be issued a Form DS-2019 visa document so that you can apply for a J-1 visa and enter the U.S. in J-1 status. Steps to Receive Your DS-2019 Obtain an invitation from a sponsoring Clark department or center/institute Your sponsoring department will submit a request to the ISSO on your behalf for a visa document Work with the ISSO to submit necessary immigration and financial documents Acceptable financial documents include: Funding letter from your home government or institution Personal or family bank statement Receive your DS-2019 for yourself and any J-2 dependents Apply for your visa For scholars staying more than six months with no Clark funding: pay a $200 international scholar fee upon arrival. International Employee Visa Process If you are an international employee who has been hired by Clark as a faculty member or researcher, the University’s International Students and Scholars Office (ISSO) will work with your department to facilitate the visa sponsorship process. Once your hiring department contacts the ISSO, the ISSO will review your case to determine the most appropriate visa category for you. This process will include a review of your immigration history, whether you are currently in the United States, and the type of employment you have been offered. Talk to your department as soon as you have confirmed your intention to accept (or continue) employment at Clark. Your department is responsible for contacting the ISSO to start the process to request a visa document once you have confirmed your intent to work at Clark. Departments should initiate the visa sponsorship process as soon as possible. Once your department has started the process, you will be contacted by the ISSO to provide any information and documentation needed in the visa sponsorship process. The ISSO will provide you with the documents that you need from Clark to apply for your visa If you are currently physically present in the United States, Clark/the ISSO may pursue a Change of Status application for you. If this is the case, you will still need to apply for a visa the next time you travel outside of the United States. Contact the ISSO for more information. If you are a citizen of Canada, you will typically not need a visa to enter the United States, but you will need your sponsorship documents from Clark and will need to follow all the rules and regulations of your visa status. When you arrive, you will be contacted by Human Resources to complete the onboarding and orientation process. If you have any questions, please contact the ISSO at isso@clarku.edu. I-20 Frequently Asked Questions How do I request my I-20? After you deposit the enrollment fee you will receive an email inviting you to the ISSO Portal to submit your I-20 request. Keep in mind it can take 2-3 business days for you to receive your invitation to the ISSO Portal once I-20 processing has opened for your admissions term. I haven’t received my I-20 or instructions on requesting my I-20. Where can I get this information? All communication regarding your I-20 will go to your Clark email address. It is VERY important to set up your Clark email and check it every day. You should also check your Junk or Spam folder and ensure your email security setting is not blocking emails from Clark University. What are the Estimated Costs and where can I find them? You can find the Estimated Costs here. How long until I get my I-20 once I complete my request? Keep in mind it can take up to 5 business days for your request to be reviewed. Business days are Monday-Friday. Check your Clark email for all updates. What is an Affidavit of Support? When do we need it? The Affidavit of Support is a sworn statement by your sponsor to guarantee payment of your tuition and fees to Clark University. This document is needed for any financial document you provide that lists the account holder as someone other than yourself. You must use Clark’s Affidavit of Support form. What kinds of financial documents are acceptable? How recent should they be? Unacceptable bank documents can slow down the processing of your I-20 request. To help you get your I-20 as fast as possible, please be sure your bank documents meet the following requirements: Are less than 6 months old AND include the date you received the document Represent liquid assets (we cannot accept stocks, property titles, etc.) Include the name of the account holder Indicate the currency Examples of acceptable financial documents include: Bank certificate Savings and checking bank account statement. Please note, transaction history does not need to be included. Loan approval notices (including conditional approvals) Private scholarships If you have a question about a document, please email isso@clarku.edu. The ISSO reserves the right to request any submitted document, such as a bank statement, to be officially translated into English. How can I have a successful VISA Interview? The International Students and Scholars Office provides a Visa Success Guide available here. Are international students allowed to work? In the first two semesters, international students are permitted to obtain on-campus employment only. CPT is only available after completing two full-time semesters and requires prior approval. OPT is generally completed after graduation. For more information, click here. I need help. Can I meet with a staff member? Yes! We have ZOOM DROP-IN ADVISING HOURS: FRIDAYS 9:00AM-11:00AM EST. Why doesn’t my I-20 Major/CIP Code match the name of my Clark degree program? Your I-20 Major/CIP Code will not always match the name of your Clark degree program. The CIP code indicated on your I-20 is the government code designated for your major. The National Center for Educational Statistics provides the following explanation of CIP codes: “The CIP is the accepted federal government statistical standard on instructional program classifications and is used in a variety of education information surveys and databases. The CIP titles and program descriptions are intended to be generic categories into which program completions data can be placed, not exact duplicates of a specific major or field of study titles used by individual institutions. CIP codes are standard statistical coding tools that reflect current practice, and are not a prescriptive list of officially recognized or permitted programs. The CIP is not intended to be a regulatory device. CIP codes, for the most part, are not intended to correspond exclusively to any specific degree or program level. In most cases, any given instructional program may be offered at various levels, and CIP codes are intended to capture all such data.” For more information on CIP codes please click here. My I-20 is for 9 months. Why is it shown as 9 months when my program is 18 months? The I-20 document is for the purpose of obtaining a visa. It shows the Consulate that you have the necessary funding to pay for the academic year, which is a nine-month period. Why does my I-20 state I am in the Pathway program? What does this mean? Can I get an I-20 with my major? The ISSO issues your I-20 based on your admissions letter. If you have questions regarding your program of study, please contact Graduate Admissions at gradadmissions@clarku.edu. If you successfully complete your Pathway Program, the ISSO will issue you an updated I-20 with your degree program. The course catalog course fees and/or my bill from Student Accounts does not match with the financials listed on the I-20. Is this a problem? The financials listed on the I-20 are the estimated costs of funding needed for the first academic year. The ISSO uses the Estimated Cost of Attendance chart when issuing your I-20. Your actual costs for tuition, fees, and living expenses may not exactly match the I-20. If you have questions about our bill, please contact Student Accounts at saccounts@clarku.edu. What documents do I need to have for my interview with the US Embassy? Every US Consulate and Embassy has its own process and the documents required may vary. For a general guide, visit Study in the States. H-4 Dependents Please see the information below on bringing dependent family members with you. Please note that H-1B employees have the responsibility for obtaining and ensuring immigration compliance for any dependents in H-4 status. The ISSO can provide general advice or refer you to an immigration attorney for assistance on specific matters relating to the legal affairs of family members. Consular Processing or Change of Status If your dependents are outside of the U.S. and wish to accompany you to the U.S. as H-4 dependents, they will need to apply for H-4 visas at a U.S. consulate (note: citizens of Canada are not required to apply for visas, but must show documents establishing eligibility at the U.S. port of entry.) Dependents may apply for H-4 visas at the same time you apply for your own H-1B visa, or separately if they plan to join you in the U.S. later. For visa application instructions, review the information provided by the S. consulate where you and/or your family members will apply for your visas. At minimum, your dependents should be prepared to show the following: Valid passport Copy of the H-1B employee’s passport identity page and H-1B visa (if applying after the H-1B employee has obtained their own visa) Copy of the I-797 Approval Notice showing Clark University as the employer Copy of the H-1B employee’s employment offer letter. Proof of marital/family relationship between the H-1B employee and the H-4 spouse and/or dependent children Change of Status Within the U.S. To change to H-4 status from another status, the dependent must file Form I-539 (and Form I-539A, if necessary, for each additional co-applicant, such as dependent minor children) along with the correct fees and supporting materials to the USCIS. Eligibility to do an in-country change to H-4 status may depend on several factors, including the dependent’s current status and status expiration date. Because of legal limitations, the ISSO is unable to advise directly on individual cases. We recommend consulting with an immigration attorney for specific guidance on completing a Form I-539 change of status application. As a courtesy, the ISSO is able to include Forms I-539 and I-539A and filing fees with a petition for an H-1b employer. Apply for Your Visa What is a U.S. Entry Visa? As a citizen of a foreign country, you must obtain a U.S. visa, which is placed in your passport and allows you to seek entry into the United States for the purpose indicated on your visa (e.g. study, research, employment). To understand the length of your visa, visit the U.S. State Department’s visa reciprocity page and search for your country and visa type (e.g., “F” for F-1 visa). The length of your visa is not determined by the length of your DS-2019 or Form I-20 but on agreements between your country of citizenship and the United States. How to Obtain Your Visa When you receive your visa document from Clark or USCIS (e.g., Form I-20, Form DS-2019, I-797 Approval Notice), check it to make sure the information is correct. Contact the ISSO if you have any questions or notice any errors on your form. Make your visa appointment at a U.S. consulate in your country of citizenship or legal permanent residence. Follow all steps as directed by the consulate where you will be applying for you visa, as procedures vary by county. Schedule your visa appointment as soon as possible to avoid possible delays. If necessary, complete the Form DS-160 Nonimmigrant Visa Application and pay the DS-160 fee. F-1/J-1 Visa Applicants: You will need your SEVIS number to make your appointment. The SEVIS number can be found on your Form I-20 or DS-2019 F-1/J-1 Visa Applicants: Pay your I-901 SEVIS Fee at least three days before your visa appointment. Read Tips for a Successful Visa Appointment Prepare your visa application materials, including but not limited to: Your passport, which should be valid at least six months into the future Your visa document (Form I-20, DS-2019, etc.) U.S. passport photos F-1/J-1 Visa Applicants: Your I-901 SEVIS fee payment receipt (F and J visa applicants only) Financial documents, such as your scholarship letter(s), bank statements, or job offer letter from Clark Students: Your Clark admission letter Scholars/Employees: Appointment letter Passports and proof of family relationship for any dependent family members coming with you to the U.S. Passports must be valid at least six months into the future Additional supporting materials as instructed by the ISSO or the U.S. consulate The U.S. consulate will provide important instructions regarding the visa approval process, timelines, and pick-up instructions. Plan your arrival to the United States. F-1/J-1 Visa Holders: You are permitted to enter the U.S. 30 days or less before the start date printed on your Form I-20 or DS-2019. Contact the ISSO if you will be arriving later than the program start date on your Form I-20 or DS-2019. Visa Delays and Denials Sometimes applicants for visas may face delays or denials for reasons such as missing documents or inability to demonstrate non-immigrant intent. In other cases, a visa application may be delayed due to a security check, which is known as administrative processing. Contact the ISSO if you have any questions. If I am already in the United States, do I need a visa? If you are currently in the United States, contact the ISSO with details about your specific immigration status and situation. The ISSO may recommend that you change your status from within the United States before joining Clark. In other cases, the ISSO may recommend that you depart the United States and return with a new visa. Contact the ISSO if you have questions about change of status. Tips for a Successful Visa Appointment Know what to expect: Interviews at U.S. consular posts are typically set up so that you are standing at a counter while other people wait and watch in the background. For security reasons, a thick piece of glass typically separates you from the interviewing officer. Before you even get to the counter, you will have to go through a strict security screening process (similar to an airport) and may wait for several hours for your case to be called. Ensure you arrive with plenty of extra time to go through security and prepare for your interview. Come with the right documents: It is critical to arrive at your interview with all necessary documents. Dress and act professionally: The ISSO recommends wearing business attire to your interview. When speaking to the officer, speak as confidently as you can and maintain good posture. Familiarize yourself with your application materials: Most questions you will be asked at the interview will already be addressed in your application materials. It is important that you familiarize yourself with the details of your Clark materials, DS-160, and all other supporting docs before your appointment. Demonstrate nonimmigrant intent: Most U.S. visas are granted for nonimmigrant intent. This means that your purpose for coming to the United States is temporary, and you do not intend to stay in the United States. The consular officer may deny your application if they believe you intend to stay in the U.S. permanently. Be prepared to show ties to your home country such as family ties, employment, or property. This may be difficult for a student to show, so be ready to talk about future career plans in your home country. Note: The H1-B visa is considered a dual-intent visa, which means that you can plan to either return to your home country or eventually apply for permanent residency in the United States. Biometrics will be collected when you apply for a U.S. visa. Consular officers have absolute authority to grant or deny visas, and their decisions cannot be overturned. If denied, you can re-apply for the visa if you can provide additional supporting documents. F-1/J-1 students: Be prepared to answer questions such as “Why do you want to pursue this field of study?” or “Why did you choose Clark University?” Your application may be denied if the consular officer suspects that you have accepted Clark University’s offer of admission but do not intend to be a student. F-1/J-1 students: Bring financial documentation to show your ability to support yourself during your time in the U.S. — examples include financial aid documents, bank statements, and affidavits of support. F-1/J-1 students and scholars: Be prepared to demonstrate your nonimmigrant intent: Outline post-graduation plans upon returning to your home country. Document family ties, business interests and assets in your home country. Discuss job prospects in your home country upon completion of your program. Clark employees: Prepare yourself for questions. Be prepared to talk about yourself and your work. For many individuals, it may seem odd to discuss one’s credentials. However, it is important to realize that your eligibility for a particular visa category is almost always dependent on these credentials. When answering questions, you should focus on demonstrating that you meet the legal standard for admission in a particular visa category. Another important consideration is that you should not become too technical while discussing your jobs, as consular officers cannot be expected to possess specialized knowledge in every industry. Finally, we encourage you to speak truthfully, as your credibility is key to a successful interview. Listen carefully to each question, give a complete answer, and do not simply give one-word answers. I-901 SEVIS Fee for F-1 and J-1 Students F-1 students and J-1 students and scholars are required to pay the I-901 SEVIS fee when applying for a visa for the first time. The SEVIS fee is used to support and maintain the U.S. government’s Student and Exchange Visitor Information (SEVIS) system. The SEVIS fee is usually a one-time fee that lasts the duration of your F-1 studies or J-1 program. You will need to pay a new fee if you take an extended leave of absence from your program or if you return to the United States in the future for a new program. Only the person on the F-1 student or J-1 student/scholar visa needs to pay the fee. F-2 or J-2 family members are exempt from the fee. Canadian Citizens If you are a citizen of Canada, you are not required to apply for a visa before entering the United States to study, teach, or engage in research. However, you must carry an appropriate immigration paperwork from Clark such as your Form I-20, Form DS-2019, or Form I-797 H1-B approval. Frequently Asked Questions I am going to be joining Clark as a student, scholar or employee. I already have a tourist visa/I am eligible for the visa waiver program. Do I need to get a new visa? Yes, you will need a new visa. You cannot enter the United States to work or study on a tourist visa. Doing so would be a violation of your tourist status. You must enter the U.S. in the appropriate visa status for your planned activities. Can I study part-time on my F-1 or J-1 visa? No, you must enroll as a full-time student to be eligible for a F-1 or J-1 student visa. I am already in the U.S. Can I get a new visa from here? Contact the ISSO for more information. The ISSO will need to assess your individual situation and immigration status before we can advise if you will need to leave the U.S. and get a new visa or if you are eligible for a change of status. It may also be necessary or advisable for you to consult an immigration attorney. Do I need F-1 or J-1 Status? Most international students at Clark are in F-1 status. For most students, whether they are F-1 or J-1 is determined based on your program of study at Clark. If you are enrolled in one of the few programs that are available in both F-1 and J-1 status, consider the following differences between the two statuses when deciding which status to choose. F-1 Status J-1 Status Source of Funding No funding source requirements. Please find more information on acceptable personal assets here. Majority of funding must come from source other than personal assets. On-Campus Employment Up to 20 hours a week during school sessions, and full-time during breaks. No permissions required. Must first get permission from program sponsor. 20 hours a week during school sessions, and full time during breaks.

Off-Campus Employment After Program Optional Practical Training (OPT) is most often done to work after graduation. OPT is 12 months, and some STEM majors can request a further 24 month extension. No job offer is required prior to OPT application. Academic training – Duration equal to length or study or 18 months, whichever is shorter and not previously used during studies. PhD students are eligible for up to 36 months. Graduating students must have job offer within 30 days of graduation, and will be tied to a specific employer. Dependents F-2 dependents cannot work. J-2 dependents can apply for employment authorization with USCIS upon arrival. Home Country Return Requirements No requirement to return to home country upon program completion. Some J-1 students may be subject to a 2-year home residency requirement upon program completion. Starting a New Program No limit on how many programs can be done or when. J-1 students in an academic program 6 months of longer MUST wait at least 12 months before they can do another J-1 program. See more about the Bar here. Planning Your Arrival in the U.S. The following information is meant to help you prepare to enter the United States and have the smoothest trip possible. How soon can I arrive? There are rules for how early you can arrive in the United States the first time you are traveling in a new visa category. F-1 students: You may arrive up to 30 days before the program start date printed on your Clark Form-I-20 J-1 students and J-1 scholars: You may arrive up to 30 days before the program start date printed on your Clark or J-1 program sponsor DS-2019 H1-B temporary workers: You may arrive up to 10 days before the validity date on your I-797 Approval Notice. Your earliest arrival date may also be printed on your H-1B visa. Other visa types: Contact the ISSO if you have questions about your arrival date. U.S. Customs and Border Protection Inspection When you arrive at a port-of-entry to the United States, you will be subject to inspection by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers. CBP officers will conduct the Immigration, Customs, and Agriculture components of the Inspections process. A CBP official will inspect your travel documents, ask you questions, and make the final decision about your admissibility to enter the United States. Be prepared to discuss you reasons for coming to the United States — such as to study, do research, or teach at Clark — and the expected length of your stay in the U.S. You can find more information about the admissions requirements and process on the CBP International Visitors webpage. If you are flying to the U.S., make sure you bring all your travel documents with you in your carry-on and do not put them in your checked luggage as you will not have access to luggage until after you clear customs. For more information about CBP inspection, you can check out CBP’s Know Before You Go page. Documents You Will Need at U.S. Port of Entry Unexpired passport that will be valid at least six months into the future on the day you return to the United States Your visa document from Clark (Form I-20 / Form DS-2019 / I-797 Approval Notice) A valid U.S. visa (exception: Canadian citizens do not require visas) Supporting documents such as: Financial documents, such as your bank statements, scholarship letters, or job offer letters from Clark F-1 and J-1 visa holders: Your I-901 SEVIS fee payment receipt F-1 and J-1 students: Your admission letter Employees and research scholars: Your appointment letter Employees and scholars: CV or resume Other evidence that shows your purpose for coming to the U.S. Your I-94 Record Upon arrival, CBP gathers travelers’ arrival/departure information automatically from their electronic travel records. This electronic record of your arrival is also known as your I-94. Every time you enter the United States, a CBP officer must update your I-94 with the date you entered and the status (e.g., F-1, J-1, H1-B) with which you were admitted to the U.S. This electronic record is your proof of legal admission into the U.S. in the appropriate student, scholar, or employee status. After arriving in the U.S., make sure you download a copy of your I-94 from CPB’s I-94 lookup site and ensure that it is accurate. Contact the ISSO immediately if you are not able to locate your I-94 or there are errors; any mistakes need to be corrected right away. F-1 and J-1 visa holders, and their F-2 / J-2 dependents, should always have an I-94 that indicates an “admit until” date of “D/S.” D/S stands for “duration of status,” which means that you are allowed to remain in the U.S. for as long as your F or J documents are unexpired and you are continuing to pursue your program of study, research, or teaching at Clark.

It is important for you to read through this section carefully and understand what rules you must follow. The ISSO is here to advise you and answer any questions you might have. Maintaining your F-1 status is critically important because even if you unintentionally violate the rules, there can be serious repercussions including losing your F-1 status or benefits such as on-campus employment or the possibility of practical training. Maintain Valid Immigration Documents You are required to have a valid, unexpired passport at all times. If you are in the U.S. and your passport will expire within the next 12 months, you should contact your embassy or consulate to get your passport renewed. You also need to have a valid, unexpired Form I-20 from Clark University that has the correct degree program, major, and expected program end date. Contact the ISSO if you need to make any changes to your I-20. There may be times when you need additional time to complete your program. Visit the I-20 Extension section for more information. Enroll Full Time Each Semester Clark University considers three units (courses) per semester as full-time status. Therefore, you need to enroll in at least three units each semester. You may be able to maintain full-time enrollment by taking classes at Clark and at another SEVIS-approved U.S. institution. You must get approval from the ISSO to take courses at another institution and have it count toward your full-time enrollment. Summers are usually considered official vacation periods that do not require full-time enrollment. However, if you enroll for the first time at Clark during the summer session, then you will need to enroll full time. You may request a reduced course load by logging into your ISSO Portal account and going to the Control Center. NOTE: An unauthorized drop below full-time status will lead to termination of your F-1 student status. Normal Academic Progress All international students are expected to make normal academic progress. This means that you are in good academic standing and are making the normal progress toward degree completion. Please check with the ISSO if you have questions about this requirement. Update Your Address You are required to update your current U.S. residential address and phone number with Clark and the Student Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) within 10 days of the change. Please visit our Update Your Address page for specific instructions. Follow F-1 Employment Rules Working without proper authorization is a serious violation of your F-1 student status. Make sure you read the F-1 employment page carefully and contact the ISSO with any questions. Do Not Remain in the U.S. After Your '60-Day Grace Period' Once you complete your program of study, you have 60 days in which you are allowed to prepare for departure from the U.S. This period of time is referred to as a “grace period.” This period of time is intended for you to make arrangements to leave the U.S. You are not allowed to work during the grace period. If you leave the U.S. during your grace period, you cannot re-enter the U.S. in F-1 status. The grace period starts the day after the end date on your Form I-20 or the day after you complete your degree requirements, whichever is earlier. If you believe that the end date on your I-20 is not accurate, contact the ISSO immediately. The grace period ends once you leave the U.S. or by the end of the 60th day, whichever comes first. You may also pursue other immigration options during the grace period, such as applying for post-completion Optional Practical Training or requesting an F-1 transfer to another school. Reduced Course Load F-1 students are required to maintain full-time student status. Clark defines full-time as a minimum of three units or courses per semester. Failure to study full-time is considered a serious violation of F-1 regulations. However, there are certain circumstances in which you are able to request permission to take less than a full course load. In all but one case, you need to get approval from the ISSO before dropping below full-time enrollment. If you are approved by the ISSO to take a reduced course load, you are considered to be maintaining valid F-1 student status. Please meet with an ISSO adviser to discuss how a reduced course load may affect your off-campus employment eligibility. You may be eligible for a reduced course load if any of the following situations apply to you. Academic Challenges During Semester You can request permission to reduce to part-time enrollment during your first semester of studies if any of the following reasons apply: Initial challenges with studying in English Improper course placement (you registered for a course that appeared to be the appropriate level for you but was too advanced) Issues with reading requirements Difficulty adjusting to U.S. teaching methods You are only allowed to be granted a reduced course load in this category once per degree level Medical Reasons If you are experiencing a medical condition that prevents you from being able to study full-time, you can request a reduced course load that would allow you to withdraw from one, some, or all of your courses. You must provide the ISSO a written letter from a licensed medical doctor, clinical psychologist, or doctor of osteopathy that recommends a reduced course load for medical reasons. You are eligible for up to three semesters of a reduced course load due to medical reasons. However, you need to make a separate request for each semester and provide an updated letter from your licensed clinician. Do NOT withdraw from any courses until you have authorization from the ISSO. Final Semester If you are in your final semester, you are not required to study full-time if you need less than a full course load to complete your program requirements. Example: if you only have two classes left to complete your program, you only need to register for those two classes. This is the only case when a student does not need to request a reduced course load from the ISSO. Submit a Reduced Course Load request through the ISSO Portal. Take a Leave of Absence F-1 students may find that they need to take a leave of absence (LOA) from Clark for a variety of reasons. If you are planning to take a leave, you must notify the ISSO before you withdraw or stop attending classes. In most cases, taking a LOA will require you to leave the U.S. since you will not be maintaining a full course load. Types of Leaves Students may take a leave of absence for various reasons, including: Required withdrawal for academic reasons Medical leave of absence Voluntary leave of absence (for personal or family reasons, home country military service, or other similar reasons) Study abroad leave of absence If you are an undergraduate student taking a Clark or non-Clark study abroad LOA (also called a foreign leave), you may be able to continue to maintain your F-1 status as long as both of the below are true: You are participating in a Clark University-recognized study abroad or away program or if your LOA has been approved by the director of study abroad and away, and You have obtained approval from the ISSO prior to departure from Clark. In some cases, if you leave the U.S. and remain outside for more than five months, you are no longer maintaining your F-1 status and will need to have a new SEVIS record and I-20 issued in order for you to re-enter the U.S. It is important for you to contact the ISSO to discuss how your leave of absence may impact your F-1 status and your option for Curricular or Optional Practical Training. Undergraduate Students If you need to take a leave of absence (LOA), you must first notify the Dean of Students Office. You must then submit your leave of absence request through the ISSO Portal. If you have questions about how taking a leave of absence will impact your studies and F-1 status, please first email the ISSO. Graduate or Non-Matriculated Students If you are a graduate student, you must first discuss your leave of absence (LOA) with your academic department/school. After you’ve informed your department/school of your plans, you must submit a Leave of Absence request through the ISSO Portal. If you have questions about how taking a Leave of Absence will impact your studies and F-1 status, please first email the ISSO. Returning to Clark After a Leave of Absence When you are ready to return to Clark after a leave of absence (LOA), please notify the ISSO approximately three to six months before your intended return. The ISSO will determine whether you need a new I-20 visa document or whether you can use the most recent one that was issued to you. You cannot return to the U.S. with your previous I-20 unless you receive written confirmation from the ISSO that you may do so. If you are an undergraduate student, you need to contact the Dean of Students Office to start the re-enrollment process. If you are returning from an approved leave for a study abroad program, this step is not necessary. Graduate students will need to contact their department/school to request to be readmitted. While on your leave of absence, you will not have access to the ISSO portal. After your department/school/Dean of Student’s Office has re-enrolled you in Clark’s records, you will receive an email inviting you to log into the ISSO portal again. You will be asked to fill in your new ISSO profile and provide updated financial documents to cover at least one year of full-time tuition, required fees, and living expenses. This information is listed in the Estimated Costs in the ISSO Portal. You will also need to provide confirmation that you have been approved to return from leave from either the Dean of Students Office (UG) or your department/school (graduate or non-matriculated.) Extend Your Program How to Extend Your F-1 Status As mentioned in the section on maintaining your F-1 student status, you must always have a valid I-20. Under certain specific circumstances, the ISSO can process an F-1 program extension and issue you a new Form I-20 with a new end date. Program extensions must be done before your current I-20 expires. It is important for you to know when your I-20 expires. The “Program End Date” is printed on Page 1 of your I-20. It is your responsibility to request a program extension if you will not finish your program by the date indicated on your I-20. Program Extension Eligibility The ISSO can extend your I-20 only if your program completion is delayed due to compelling academic or medical reasons. If the delay in your completion is due to any of the following areas, you may be eligible to apply for a program extension: Change or add a new major Change in thesis or dissertation research topics Unexpected thesis or dissertation research problems A documented medical illness Delays due to previously approved leaves of absence (semesters outside the U.S. due to family or other reasons) Other documented academic or medical reasons You are not eligible for a program extension in order to take additional courses that are not required for you to complete your program of study. Transfer Deadline You must request an F-1 transfer and the transfer must take place no later than 60 days after completing your Clark program. If you are on post-completion Optional Practical Training (OPT) or the STEM OPT extension, the transfer must take place no later than 60 days after stopping employment or after the expiration of your Employment Authorization (EAD) card, whichever comes first. If you plan to start studying at another school without completing your Clark program, talk to an ISSO adviser about your options. When to Apply for an Extension It is important for you to request a program extension as early as possible so that you have time to gather all of the necessary documents. Please submit your request for a Program Extension at least one month before your current program end date, which is the expiration of your I-20. The ISSO cannot process a program extension after your I-20 has expired. Change Academic Level Some students come to Clark and complete one academic level and then enroll in another program at Clark. For example: if you successfully completed the Graduate Pathway Program at Clark, you need to submit a Change of Education Level request to receive your I-20 for your master’s degree program at Clark. Eligibility and Process You are currently in valid F-1 status and are completing a Clark program of study (or are completing post-completion Optional Practical Training based on your Clark program). You have been admitted to a new program at Clark and the new program will start in the next available semester following completion of studies. Example: A student who completes their bachelor’s degree in June and will begin their master’s degree in the fall semester. You should submit your request for a Change of Level early. To ensure that the ISSO has enough time to process your Change of Education Level request, you must submit your request no later than 45 days after your program end date. The ISSO cannot approve a request and issue a new I-20 for the new program after the last day of the 60-day Grace Period. Submit your Change of Education Level request through the ISSO Portal. Transfer to Another School F-1 Transfer-Out Process If you decide to attend another school in the U.S. while you hold F-1 status through Clark (including any time on OPT), you must contact the ISSO to have your F-1 SEVIS record transferred to your new school. Once your new school receives your SEVIS record, they can issue a new Form I-20 for your new program. F-1 Transfer-Out Eligibility You must be maintaining valid F-1 status You must be admitted to a full-time program at another SEVIS-approved institution in the U.S. Classes at your new school must begin no later than five months after your last day of classes at Clark (or the last day of employment if you are on OPT or STEM OPT) Transfer-Out Deadline Students should apply for a transfer as soon as they are certain that they are going to attend the new school. Do not wait until the end of your grace period, as the ISSO needs time to process your request. Students who are completing their Clark program — the transfer must take place no later than 60 days after completing your Clark program. Students on OPT or STEM OPT — the transfer must take place no later than 60 days after stopping employment or after the expiration of your Employment Authorization (EAD) card, whichever comes first. If you plan to start studying at another school without completing your Clark program, talk to an ISSO adviser about your options. Transfer-Out Request Process Once admitted to another SEVIS-approved institution, you will receive instructions from your new school about the transfer process. In many cases, your new school may give you an F-1 transfer request form that will need to be completed by the ISSO. Once you are certain you will attend the new school, submit a Transfer-Out request through the ISSO Portal. To complete the Transfer-Out request, you will need: A copy of your admission letter to your new school. Any F-1 transfer-in forms that your new school may need the ISSO to complete the transfer process, if applicable. Your requested transfer release date. In most cases, the “transfer out” or SEVIS release date will be the day after you complete your program of study at Clark or the day after your EAD card expires if you are on post-completion OPT or STEM OPT. Important: If you are on post-completion OPT or STEM OPT, your OPT authorization ends immediately once your record is transferred to your new school. You must also tell the ISSO the school’s name and SEVP school code of the school you are attending as part of your Transfer-Out request. Different schools can have more than one SEVP school code, depending on whether they have more than one campus or academic location. If you are unsure about your new school’s SEVP school code, ask an international student advisor at your new school. Once the ISSO approves your request, your SEVIS record will be transferred to your new school on your “transfer release date.” Your new school will receive your SEVIS record on the release date and will be able to produce a new Form I-20 for “Transfer Pending.” Once your record is transferred to your new school, you will need to send all immigration-related questions to the international student office at your new institution, including questions on travel, arrival, and employment as they will have authority over your SEVIS record. Add F-2 Dependents If you are, or plan to become an F-1 student at Clark University, your legal spouse and/or unmarried dependent children under 21 are eligible to apply for F-2 status. You must be in valid F-1 status for your dependents to qualify for F-2 status. To obtain F-2 status for your dependents, you must first request a separate Form I-20 for each dependent. Submit a Dependent Request through the ISSO Portal to add one or more dependents to your F-1 record. To complete the Dependent Request, you will need: Copy of the passport identification page for each dependent. Copy of your marriage license if your spouse’s name is different than yours. Financial documents showing that you, or your sponsor, have sufficient funds for at least one year of living expenses for your dependents. If the financial documents (bank statement) are not in your name, your financial sponsor must also submit a signed Clark Affidavit of Support. The ISSO will review your request and will issue Form I-20s for your dependents if all paperwork is in order. F-2 dependents must apply for an F-2 visa from a U.S. consulate overseas (exception: Canadian citizens do not require entry visas) and enter with their own I-20s. If your F-2 dependents are applying for visas and/or coming to the U.S. separately from you, they should carry copies of your I-20, passport, F-1 visa, I-901 SEVIS fee payment receipt, and financial documents. If your F-1 status ends for any reason, the F-2 status of any dependents ends as well. F-2 Study and Employment Limitations for Dependents Dependents in F-2 status cannot work. F-2 spouses may study, but only on a part-time basis. F-2 children can attend elementary or secondary school. Children lose F-2 eligibility once they reach 21. Online Study Limitations The International Student and Scholars Office received notice from the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) that the COVID Guidelines announcing the relaxation of online study limits will end after the 2023 Summer term. SEVP guidance has returned to normal limits on online courses. F-1 students will only be able to count one online course toward their full-time enrollment requirements.

The information on this page is for J-1 students whose DS-2019 J-1 visa documents are issued by Clark. If your DS-2019 was issued by another organization, such as Fulbright or IIE, you must contact them regarding how to maintain your J-1 status and for issues such as travel, employment authorization, or extensions of stay. If you are sponsored by an external sponsor, Clark University’s International Center still considers you an important member of our international community and welcomes you to participate in events and programs and access other resources during your time in Worcester. Maintain Your J-1 Status It is very important for students who hold J-1 status to follow all of the regulations so that they can maintain their valid immigration status. It is important for you to read through this section carefully and understand what rules you must follow. The ISSO is here to advise you and answer any questions you might have. Maintaining your J-1 status is critically important because even if you unintentionally violate the rules, there can be serious repercussions including losing your J-1 status or benefits such as on-campus employment or the possibility of academic training. Maintain Valid Immigration Documents You are required to have a valid, unexpired passport at all times. If you are in the U.S., and your passport will expire within the next 12 months, you should contact your embassy or consulate to get your passport renewed. You also need to have a valid, unexpired Form DS-2019 from Clark University that has the correct program of study, major, and expected program end date. Contact the ISSO if you need to make any changes to your DS-2019. If you need more time to complete your program, you must contact the ISSO BEFORE your DS-2019 expires. Extensions may be completed only if there are compelling academic or medical reasons for needing more time to complete your program. To request an extension of your DS-2019 end date, please meet with your academic adviser or Registrar to discuss your academic plan. Upon receiving approval for extension, complete the Program Extension Request located in your Control Center of the ISSO Portal. Enroll Full-Time You must enroll full-time during the fall and spring semesters. Clark defines “full-time” as taking at least three units (courses) per semester. You may take summers as a vacation, unless full-time enrollment is required by your program. You must not withdraw from a course without first getting authorization from an ISSO adviser if withdrawing will cause you to drop below full-time. An unauthorized drop below full-time status will lead to termination of your J-1 student status. You can find more information and steps to request a reduced course load here. Normal Academic Progress You must maintain satisfactory academic standing and make normal, full-time progress toward reaching your degree or educational objective. Update Your Address You are required to update your current U.S. residential address and phone number with Clark and the Student Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) within 10 days of the change. Please visit our Update Your Address page for specific instructions. Comply with J-1 Health Insurance Mandate J-1 visa holders (and J-2 dependents) are required to have health insurance that meets J-1 visa requirements for health insurance. If you are not receiving your health insurance through the Clark University Student Health Insurance plan, you must purchase alternative insurance that meets the J-1 visa health insurance requirements. Follow J-1 Employment Rules Working without the proper authorization is a serious violation of your J-1 student status. Make sure you read the J-1 Student Employment section carefully and contact the ISSO with any questions. Students in J-1 status will require additional authorization to be allowed to work on campus. If Clark is your program sponsor, please contact the ISSO for more information about how to obtain this permission. If Clark is not your program sponsor, please contact your program sponsor to determine if you can work on campus during your program. Working without authorization is considered a serious violation of immigration status and may require you to leave the U.S. Do Not Remain in the U.S. After Your ‘30-Day Grace Period’ Once you complete your program of study, you have 30 days in which you are allowed to prepare for departure from the U.S. This period of time is referred to as a “Grace Period.” This period of time is intended for you to make arrangements to leave the U.S. You are not allowed to work during the grace period. If you leave the U.S. during your Grace Period, you cannot re-enter the U.S. in J-1 status. The grace period starts the day after the end date of your Form DS-2019 or the day after you complete your degree requirements, whichever is earlier. If you believe that the end date on your DS-2019 is not accurate, contact the ISSO immediately. The grace period ends once you leave the U.S. or by the end of the 30th day, whichever comes first. If you intend to pursue other immigration options such as applying for Academic Training or requesting a J-1 transfer to another school, you MUST do this before the program end date on your DS-2019. You cannot request Academic Training or transfer to another school during your grace period. Reduced Course Load J-1 students are required to maintain full-time student status. Clark defines full-time as a minimum of three units or courses per semester. Failure to study full-time is considered a serious violation of J-1 regulations. However, there are certain circumstances in which you are able to request permission to take less than a full course load. In all but one case, you need to get approval from the ISSO before dropping below full-time enrollment. The following are situations in which you may be eligible for a reduced course load (part-time enrollment or no enrollment) at Clark: Official University Breaks and Vacation J-1 students are exempt from full-time enrollment during all Clark University official breaks and vacations if the student intends to register the next semester. Graduate students who begin their programs during the summer must register full-time for the summer. You do not need to request authorization from the ISSO to take a summer vacation as long as you were full-time during the previous fall and spring semesters. Medical Reasons If you are experiencing a medical condition that prevents you from being able to study full-time, you can request a reduced course load that would allow you to withdraw from one, some, or all of your courses. You must provide the ISSO a written letter from a physician that recommends a reduced course load for medical reasons. Do NOT withdraw from any courses until you have the authorization from the ISSO. Academic Reasons In limited and specific situations, you may be authorized to take a reduced course load if a reduced course load is needed for “bona fide academic reasons.” To qualify, you must provide a written letter of recommendation from your academic adviser or dean explaining the academic reasons necessitating a reduced course load. Reduced Course Load Process Gather the required documentation indicated for the category above that applies to you. Schedule an appointment with an ISSO adviser. The adviser will review your documentation and grant you written authorization if you meet the requirements for a reduced course load. Leave of Absence If you need to take a leave of absence from your J-1 program for personal reasons, you must contact the ISSO before taking your leave. In most situations, a leave of absence requires you to leave the U.S. unless you qualify for one of the reduced course load options indicated above. In addition, if the leave of absence is of an extended duration, your J-1 status may need to be shortened or terminated if you are unable to continue working toward your original J-1 program objectives. Add J-2 Dependents J-2 Dependent Eligibility If you are, or plan to become a J-1 student at Clark University, your legal spouse and/or unmarried dependent children under 21 are eligible to apply for J-2 status. You must be in valid J-1 status for your dependents to qualify for J-2 status. To obtain J-2 status for your dependents, you must first request a separate Form DS-2019 for each dependent. Submit a Dependent Request located in your Control Center of the ISSO Portal to add one or more dependents to your J-1 record. To complete the Dependent Request, you will need: Copy of the passport identification page for each dependent. Copy of your marriage license if your spouse’s name is different than yours. Financial documents showing that you, or your sponsor, have sufficient funds for at least one year of living expenses for your dependents. This amount is at least $5,700 for the first dependent and $3,600 for each additional dependent. If the financial documents (bank statement) are not in your name, your financial sponsor must also submit a signed Clark Affidavit of Support. The ISSO will review your request and will issue Forms DS-2019 for your dependents if all paperwork is in order. J-2 dependents must apply for a J-2 visa from a U.S. consulate overseas (exception: Canadian citizens do not require entry visas) and enter with their own DS-2019. If your J-2 dependents are applying for visas and/or coming to the U.S. separately from you, they should carry copies of your DS-2019, passport, J-1 visa, I-901 SEVIS fee payment receipt, and financial documents. If your J-1 status ends for any reason, the J-2 status of any dependents ends, as well. J-2 Benefits and Requirements Study J-2 family members are permitted to study on a part-time or full-time basis. Employment J-2 family members may apply to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for employment authorization only after arriving in the U.S. in J-2 status. J-2 dependents must have a valid Employment Authorization Document (EAD) before beginning work. For information on J-2 work authorization, instructions on how to apply, and current filing fees, please visit the USCIS Website. Health Insurance Dependents in J-2 status are also required to have adequate health insurance that meets J-1 visa requirements. Failure to have adequate insurance may lead to termination of status. Other Restrictions If you are subject to the two-year home residency requirement, your J-2 family members may also become subject to the requirement. In addition, the J-2 dependents of current or future J-1 research scholars and J-1 professors may also be subject to the 12- and 24-month bars on initial or repeat participation. Contact the ISSO for more information. Comply with Section 212(e): Two-Year Home Residency Requirement Some J-1 Exchange Visitors may be subject to Section 212(e) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, also referred to as the two-year home residency requirement, or two-year home country physical presence requirement. If this requirement applies to you, you are expected to return to your home country for two years following the end of your J-1 exchange program. You will be subject to this requirement if any of the following apply: Your J-1 program was supported directly or indirectly by U.S. government and/or home government funding Your J-1 subject area has been designated as a desirable skill and included by your home government on the Exchange Visitor Skills List You are a medical doctor sponsored by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) If you are unsure whether you are subject to Section 212(e), contact the ISSO so we can review your documents with you. The following chart shows how long you would have to wait (the 12 or 24 month bar) before you could obtain a new J-1 Research Scholar or Professor visa based on what your previous J status was. If you have never before had J-1 visa sponsorship, then the bars do not apply to you. Previous Scholar Visa Status For LESS than 6 months: If you have or had this J visa category Wait time for new J-1 Research Scholar/Professor visa J-1 Student Non-Degree No Wait J-1 Student No Wait J-1 Student Intern No Wait J-1 Research Scholar/Professor Category for any amount of time (one day to five years) 24 Months J-1 Short-Term Scholar No Wait J-1 Specialist No Wait J-2 Dependent of Research Scholar/Professor Category or any amount of time (one day to five years) 24 Months For MORE than 6 months: If you have or had this J visa category Wait time for new J-1 Research Scholar/Professor visa J-1 Student Non-Degree 12 Months J-1 Student 12 Months J-1 Student Intern 12 Months J-1 Specialist 12 Months J-1 Research Scholar/Professor Category for any amount of time (one day to five years) 24 Months J-2 Dependent of Research Scholar/Professor Category or any amount of time (one day to five years) 24 Months J-2 Dependent of any J-1 category except Short-Term Scholar 12 Months What if you are Subject to Section 212(e)? If you are subject to the two-year home-country physical presence requirement, you must return to your home country for a cumulative total period of at least two years before you can do any of the following: Change status while in the United States to another nonimmigrant category; Adjust status while in the United States to lawful permanent resident status; Receive an immigrant visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate; or Receive a temporary worker (H), intracompany transferee (L), or fiancé (K) visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate. You are allowed, however, to depart the U.S. and then re-enter with a new visa (other than H, K, L, and immigrant/permanent residence visas). For example, a person subject to 212(e) could return to the U.S. on a B-1/B-2 visitor’s visa, F-1 student visa, or O-1 visa. How to Satisfy the Section 212(e) Requirement The Section 212(e) Requirement applies to you until the requirement is either fulfilled or waived. For example, if you were a J-1 student subject to the requirement, but then left and immediately returned to the U.S. using another type of visa (such as an F-1 student visa), the requirement would still apply to you even after completion of your F-1 program. You would need to document your return to your home country for two years or obtain a waiver. If you are subject to Section 212(e), you must be physically present in your country of nationality or last legal permanent residence for an aggregate of at least two years after departing the U.S. at the end of your J-1 program. Since the two years of physical presence may be in the aggregate, you do not have to reside in your country of nationality or legal permanent residence in a single, continuous two-year period. Advisory Opinions and Waivers for Section 212(e) In some cases it may not be clear if you are subject to Section 212(e). In these cases you can request an Advisory Opinion from the U.S. State Department. The State Department will review copies of your J-1 requirements and determine if you are, in fact, subject to Section 212(e). If you are subject to Section 212(e) you may decide to pursue a waiver of the requirement. Waivers are granted only in certain circumstances. The ISSO is unable to assist J-1 students or scholars with the waiver process. For more information, go to the State Department’s Waiver Review web site to learn more about how to apply for a 212(e) waiver. Please contact the ISSO for more information about Advisory Opinions and Waivers.

The International Students and Scholars Office (ISSO) provides immigration support for tenured or tenure-track faculty, visiting professors, researchers, and short-term scholars at Clark. Whether you will be with us for a few weeks or several years, we are happy that you will be joining our community. We wish you a productive and enjoyable stay here at Clark University. Your sponsoring department will work with the ISSO to determine which visa category is the most appropriate for your appointment at Clark. The ISSO uses the ISSO Portal to process immigration-related paperwork and you may be asked to enter relevant information and documentation regarding your immigration status in the portal. J-1 Scholars The J-1 Exchange Visitor Program has different categories that allow institutions to bring international visitors to campus. Clark University has been approved to sponsor J-1 Exchange Visitors in the student, research scholar, professor, and short-term scholar categories. It is important to note that each J-1 category has different rules and regulations indicating which activities in which the Exchange Visitor can engage and what is required to maintain valid J-1 status. Your host department will work with the ISSO to determine the appropriate J-1 category. Please contact the ISSO if you have any questions. J-1 Research Scholars Research scholars may be either hired to a research position as an employee or invited to come to Clark on a self-funded basis to engage in independent research. Research scholars may teach at the institution that sponsored their J-1 status; if teaching becomes the primary activity, they may need to switch to the professor category. Research scholars cannot be hired to permanent positions (for example, tenure-track faculty). The appointment length must be at least three weeks and cannot exceed five years. J-1 Professors This category is used to hire individuals for temporary, non-tenure-track teaching positions. Individuals in this category may also conduct research; if research becomes the primary activity, they may need to switch to the J-1 research scholar category. The appointment length must be at least three weeks and cannot exceed five years. Short-Term Scholars Short-term scholars are professors, research scholars, or persons who travel to the U.S. for short-term visits to lecture, observe, consult, train, or demonstrate special skills. The J-1 program for a short-term scholar does not have a minimum length but cannot be more than six months. Maintaining J-1 Status Report to the ISSO upon arrival You must check in by completing the “Submit Arrival Documentation” form in the ISSO Portal. The ISSO will schedule your J-1 Scholar Orientation, which is required by the U.S. Department of State for all J-1 Exchange Visitors. Pursue the J-1 program objectives indicated on your Form DS-2019 Your status as a J-1 scholar is valid only as long as you are pursuing your J-1 program objectives as outlined on your Form DS-2019. See the J-1 Scholar Employment section below for more information about what is allowed. Maintain valid immigration documents while in the U.S. While in the U.S., you must always have a valid passport. Please contact your consulate or embassy to request an extension or new passport. Your DS-2019 — your J-1 visa documents — must also have an end date that is unexpired. It may be possible to extend your DS-2019 if you need additional time to complete your program. Please see details below. Update your U.S. residential address and contact information with the ISSO You must report any changes to your U.S. residential address, telephone, and email to the ISSO within 10 days of the change. Maintain valid J-1 health insurance for yourself and any J-2 dependents Find detailed information regarding the minimum requirements on the International Center’s health insurance information page. Travel J-1 Scholars may need to travel during their time at Clark. Please visit the Center’s travel page for more information. Extending J-1 Status If you are a J-1 scholar and need additional time to complete your program objectives, you may be eligible to request an extension of your J-1 status through the maximum duration of eligibility for your category. Extensions will not be granted if the expected time needed for your activities will take you beyond the maximum duration for your specific category (five years for J-1 research scholars and professors; six months for J-1 short-term scholars). To request an extension, contact your supervisor at least three months before your DS-2019 expires. Your department will initiate the process through the ISSO portal. If you are self-funded, you will need to submit new financial documentation to demonstrate your ability to support yourself and any J-2 dependents for the extension period. Transferring J-1 Status If you are a J-1 scholar and plan to leave your program at Clark and pursue a similar program at another institution, you may be eligible to request a transfer of your J-1 sponsorship. The transfer must be coordinated between Clark and your new institution. If you intend to transfer your J-1 sponsorship, you are still limited to the maximum duration of eligibility for your category. For example, if you were at Clark as a J-1 research scholar for a period of three years, and plan to continue your research scholar program at another institution, your new institution can sponsor you for a maximum of two years since the maximum eligibility for a J-1 research scholar is five years. Please use the ISSO Portal to initiate the transfer process. Ending or Completing J-1 Scholar Status Your J-1 scholar status ends when your DS-2019 expires or when you complete your program objectives, whichever comes first. If you complete your program objectives more than 15 days before the expiration of your DS-2019, contact the ISSO. The ISSO will need to update your J-1 SEVIS record and issue a new DS-2019 with an updated program end date. Once your program ends, you have a “grace period” of 30 days to prepare for departure from the U.S. The grace period ends automatically once you leave or at the end of the 30th day, whichever comes first. Please note that you cannot work during the grace period. If you need to end your program due to unforeseen circumstances such as illness, personal issues, loss of financial support, or other reasons, please schedule an appointment with an ISSO adviser. J-1 Scholar Employment If you are a J-1 scholar, your Form DS-2019 should indicate your sponsoring Clark department as your primary site of activity. Your DS-2019 also will indicate the salary from Clark you are expected to earn for the duration of your J-1 program. You are permitted to engage in employment only for the Clark unit listed as your primary site of activity. For example: If you are a research fellow in Chemistry you are permitted to engage in research in the Department of Chemistry. If you happen to speak French and are asked to teach a course at Clark for the Language, Literature, and Culture Department, that would not be allowed. Authorization for Occasional Lectures and Short-Term Consultation During your time in the U.S., you may be asked to visit other universities or organizations to consult or give guest lectures. This type of activity usually can be authorized by the ISSO. The activity must be “occasional” and “short-term,” which generally means that the events or activities are one-time or very limited in number and not ongoing. The organization paying you must consider you an independent contractor providing limited, short-term services and not as an ongoing employee. Occasional lectures or short-term consultations should not interfere with or delay your ability to pursue and complete your primary J-1 program goals and objectives. To request authorization for an occasional lecture or consultation, you must complete the Permission to Consult/Lecture Request on the ISSO Portal at least 10 business days before the start of your activity. Upon receipt and review of the request, the ISSO will determine if the activity qualifies for employment authorization. If it does, the ISSO will update your SEVIS record with the new site of activity and issue a letter authorizing you to engage in the activity. Adding Sites of Activity taking Place at Outside Institutions Activities at outside institutions that may be longer in duration may or may not be permitted depending on different conditions and circumstances. Ideally, you must make requests to include an additional site or sites of activity outside of Clark before starting your J-1 program at Clark, so it may be included in your J-1 program in advance. Requests received after you have already started your J-1 program will only be approved in exceptional circumstances, and require the recommendation and support of your sponsoring department at Clark. A second site of activity at an outside institution will be added to your J-1 program only if the following conditions apply. Your primary site of activity must still be your Clark department, with the majority of your time being spent at Clark. The activity’s goals and objectives are substantially the same as the activities you are undertaking at Clark (e.g., if you are a research scholar, you will be doing research in the same field at both Clark and the outside institution). Your activities at the outside institution will not cause a delay or disruption to your ability to meet your primary goals and activities at Clark. Your activities at the outside institution will not be administrative in nature or involve an offer of permanent employment. Your activities at the outside institution will help to facilitate the goals of educational and cultural exchange. To request a second site of activity, you must do the following. Obtain a written letter from the second site detailing the nature of your activities (including dates, location, duration, number of hours, a description of the activity and subject area, and compensation, if any) Obtain a letter from your Clark supervisor confirming that the proposal for a secondary activity has been reviewed and that the following are true. Your sponsor supports your participation on the grounds that the new activities would help you to achieve the educational and cultural objectives of your Clark program. The activities at the second site are substantially in the same subject area/field as your original program. Participating in an ongoing activity at a second site would not delay or disrupt your ability to achieve your primary J-1 program objectives at Clark. These documents must be submitted through the ISSO Portal with your initial request for J-1 sponsorship from Clark, or at least two weeks prior to beginning any activity at your new site. J-1 Restrictions Repeat Visitors The J-1 Exchange Visitor regulations have provisions that limit the ability of research scholars to engage in repeat visits to the U.S. using the J-1 program. The 12-month and 24-month bars are special restrictions on persons who are interested in coming to the U.S. as J-1 research scholars or J-1 professors. These bars impose a waiting period on eligibility for J-1 research scholar or J-1 professor status, depending on the individual’s prior immigration history. The 12-month Bar on Initial Participation This restriction prevents anyone who was in the U.S. for more than 6 months in the previous 12-month period to enter the U.S. on a J-1 research scholar or J-1 professor program. Example: You were in the U.S. as a J-1 student in a program that lasted two years. Following completion of the J-1 student program, you would not be eligible to return to the U.S. as a J-1 research scholar or J-1 professor until 12 months after the completion of your student program. The 24-month Bar on Repeat Participation This restriction applies ONLY if you were in the U.S. previously as a J-1 research scholar or J-1 professor. Under this requirement, you cannot return to the U.S. to participate in a new J-1 research scholar or J-1 professor program until 24 months have passed since the completion of your previous program. Example: You were in the U.S. as a J-1 research scholar in a program that lasted two years. Following completion of the J-1 research scholar program, you would not be eligible to return to the U.S. in a new J-1 research scholar or J-1 professor program until 24 months after the completion of your previous program. If you are planning to come to the U.S. as a J-1 research scholar or J-1 professor and have had previous J-1 experience, talk to an ISSO adviser about possible limitations created by these bars. 212 (e) Home Residency For more information, visit 212 (e) Home Residency page for J-1 students Adding J-2 dependents For more information, visit J-2 dependents page for J-1 students H-1B Employees Clark University uses the H-1B Temporary Worker visa often for international faculty or researchers. For more information about H-1B sponsorship, please click here. Maintaining H-1B Status As an H-1B temporary worker, you are responsible for understanding how to maintain valid H-1B status. Please read through the information below and contact the ISSO if you have any questions. Maintain valid immigration documents while in the U.S. At all times, make sure your passport remains valid for at least six months into the future. Contact your consulate or embassy to request an extension or new passport. Check your I-94 admissions record (print your I-94) or I-797 approval notice to make sure your H-1B status expiration date is in the future. Contact the ISSO if your H-1B status will expire in six months or less. Notify USCIS and Clark within 10 days of any changes to your U.S. address Report any changes to your U.S. residential address to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) within 10 days by downloading and completing Form AR-11, which may be filed using either the paper or online format. Update your address and contact information with Human Resources and with the ISSO. Do not accept outside employment As an H-1B worker sponsored by Clark, you are only allowed to work in the position for which your H-1B was sponsored. If you receive an offer for employment from an outside employer, your other employer must submit their own H-1B petition to request employment authorization for you. Contact ISSO before accepting any changes to your H-1B employment H-1B status is specific to your employer and position, so any material changes to your employment — such as a change to your department, job title, job duties, hours, or plans to take a leave of absence — must be reviewed in advance by the ISSO. Depending on the change, the ISSO may need to file a petition with USCIS to amend or update your employment authorization before your employment changes can take place. Travel using your H-1B visa and I-797 approval notice You may be able to travel outside of the U.S. while in H-1B status. Please check the International Center’s Travel page for more details. While working at Clark as an H-1B employee, travel only using your H-1B visa and I-797 approval notice from Clark (note that Canadian citizens are not required to have visas). Make sure you leave the U.S. before the expiration of your H-1B status or ask your department to submit an H-1B Extension Request in the ISSO Portal at least six months before your H-1B visa expires. Please see below for more information on extending your H-1B status. If you have any questions about when your H-1B status expires, contact the ISSO. Extending H-1B Status If you are employed as an H-1B temporary worker and your current authorization will expire before your employment at Clark is expected to end, you must talk to your department so they can initiate an H-1B extension process for you. The process for requesting an H-1B extension is similar to the process for an initial H-1B authorization; in both cases, your department must request H-1B authorization on your behalf using the ISSO Portal. H-1B Extension Eligibility You are eligible for an extension of your H-1B status if your current H-1B status is valid and you will remain employed in a specialty occupation (a position requiring specialized knowledge and skills) with your Clark department. H-1B regulations allow H-1B status to be granted up to a maximum of six years, but in increments of no more than three years at one time. Some individuals who are in the process of applying for U.S. permanent residence may be eligible for extensions beyond the sixth year. Steps to Extend H-1B Employment Authorization Department initiates extension petition with the ISSO Once it is determined that an extension petition is necessary, your department will need to initiate the extension process through the ISSO portal. The ISSO will obtain the required documents from your department and contact you to update any required information to complete the extension petition. It is important to start this process at least 4 months before your H-1B visa expires. ISSO files paperwork with the Department of Labor (DOL) Prior to filing the H-1B petition with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the ISSO needs to file a Labor Condition Application (LCA) with the DOL. A copy of the approved LCA is included with the H-1B petition and a copy will be given to the employee as well. ISSO submits the extension petition to USCIS After working with you and the department to compile all of the necessary documents, the ISSO will submit your H-1B extension. Your extension petition must be received by USCIS no earlier than six months before and no later than the last day of your current H-1B status. Once your extension is received and receipted by USCIS, your H-1B employment authorization is considered temporarily extended for 240 days while the application is processed. This temporary extension allows you to remain in the U.S. and continue your employment. USCIS approves the extension petition Once USCIS approves the petition, they will send an I-797 Approval Notice to the ISSO. The approval notice will indicate the dates of your H-1B employment authorization extension. You will need to present the approval notice to Human Resources. Important Issues to Consider Travel during USCIS Processing Once the ISSO has submitted a petition to USCIS to extend your H-1B authorization, it is essential that you do not travel outside of the U.S. while the extension petition is being processed by USCIS. If travel is required for business or personal reasons before USIC approves your H-1B extension, you must consult with your ISSO adviser so that a travel plan can be developed in consultation with you and your department. Post-Approval Travel and Visa Renewal After your extension is approved, you may need to apply for a new H-1B entry visa at a U.S. consulate if you plan to travel outside the U.S. The USCIS extension approval only extends your ability to stay in the U.S. and continue your employment. You must still obtain a valid visa in order to return from any international travel. Persons with Pending Permanent Residence Petitions If you are in H-1B status but also in the process of applying for U.S. permanent residence (whether through Clark or independently of Clark), please discuss your options for continued employment and travel with the ISSO. Extending H-4 Dependent Status If you are accompanied by H-4 dependents, as a courtesy, the ISSO will submit the H-4 extension forms with the H-1B petition. However, it the responsibility of the employee to prepare the forms and provide all necessary filing fees. Note: Each H-1B employee and their H-4 dependents are responsible for taking the appropriate steps to maintain and extend dependents’ H-4 status. The ISSO is not responsible for the accuracy of dependents’ petitions. For more information regarding H-4 eligibility and extension requirements, refer to our H-4 Dependents section. H-4 Dependents The information in this section is provided to assist H-1B employees and their dependent family members in understanding the benefits and limitations of H-4 dependent status. Please note that H-1B employees have the responsibility to obtain and ensure immigration compliance for any dependents in H-4 status. The ISSO can provide general advice or refer you to an immigration attorney for assistance on specific matters relating to the legal affairs of family members. H-4 Status H-1B employees can request H-4 status for their legal spouse and/or dependent unmarried minor children under the age of 21. Dependent children lose H-4 status when they get married or turn 21, whichever comes first. Since H-4 status is based on the principal H-1B employee’s status, dependents lose H-4 status if the employee ends or otherwise ceases to maintain valid H-1B status. H-4 Study and Employment Benefits Dependents in H-4 status are permitted to study while in the U.S., either part-time or full-time. H-4 dependents are not allowed to work while in the U.S. Certain H-4 spouses may be eligible to apply to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) for H-4 employment authorization. Employment authorization is typically available only if the principal H-1B employee is at an advanced stage of the U.S. permanent residence process. Obtaining and Extending H-4 Status For more information on bringing your dependents with you to the U.S., please see visit Coming to Clark If Clark is submitting an H-1B extension on your behalf, the ISSO is able to include Forms I-539 and I-539A and filing fees for your dependent(s) as a courtesy. Please note: The ISSO is not responsible for reviewing H-4 change-of-status or extension-of-stay applications that are included in the H-1B employee petition. It is the sole responsibility of the employee to complete the forms and ensure the accuracy of the dependent H-4 applications.

Working more than 20 hours per week will result in a violation of your immigration status. F-1 students may work full-time during official University breaks. Students with an on-campus job must apply for a Social Security number (SSN) before beginning employment.

Curricular Practical Training (CPT) Employment off campus for international students in F-1 status is strictly regulated by the U.S. government. One way that you may be able to get work authorization is through using Curricular Practical Training (CPT). CPT is defined as “a curricular practical training program that is an integral part of an established academic curriculum. Curricular practical training is defined to be alternative work/study, internship, cooperative education, or any other type of required internship or practicum that is offered by sponsoring employers through cooperative agreements with the school.” CPT authorization will allow you to accept off-campus employment when your established curriculum includes an internship, practicum, or professional experience component. CPT authorization is required for all work experience for academic credit or to fulfill an internship requirement, whether paid or unpaid. Eligibility To be eligible for CPT you must first complete two semesters of full-time study in the U.S. At Clark, full-time status each semester consists of at least three units of completion. The internship, practicum, or professional experience must be a required part of your academic program or for academic credit. The only exception to this rule is for academic programs where the curriculum requires practical training right away for ALL students — these programs are VERY limited at Clark. Limitations CPT authorization limits employment to part-time (no more than 20 hours per week) while classes are in session. You may work full-time during breaks (winter break, summer break, etc.). There is no limit on the number of times you may be authorized for CPT, but if you engage in 12 months or more of full-time CPT, you will lose eligibility for Optional Practical Training (OPT). Prior to beginning employment, you must receive authorization from the ISSO, who will record the employment in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). You will be issued a new Form I-20 with a notation that permits you to engage in CPT. CPT is authorized for a specific employer, for a specific time period, and to meet a specific academic objective. You must re-apply to the ISSO anytime you change employers, extend or shorten hours, o
