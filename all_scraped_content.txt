Submit Search Query Courses and Schedules Academic Catalog Academic Calendars Transcripts Students Faculty/Advisor Courses and Schedules Academic Catalog Academic Calendars Transcripts Students Faculty/Advisor Courses and Schedules Home Courses and Schedules Clark University students web register through the CUWeb portal. Course offerings are published at the start of advising each semester. Select the semester below for course schedules, registration dates, and final exam periods. Additional information such as the Academic Calendar, Academic Catalog, and Web Registration Instructions are included within the Registrar’s Office website. Many classroom spaces are viewable online along with a list of their Software by navigating to the ITS webpage . Class Standing Current class level for undergraduate students is calculated by the number of units earned. 0-7.99 units completed = First Year class standing 8-15.99 units completed = Sophomore class standing 16-23.99 units completed = Junior class standing 24 or more units = Senior class standing Online registration priority dates for undergraduate students(Fall & Spring), however, are determined by the student’s anticipated class as of the next semester, which includes BOTH earned units and currently registered units. For example, if a student has 12 earned units (current sophomore class) and is registered for 4 units this semester (total of 16), then that student’s anticipated class for the next semester is junior. Thus, the student’s “class for registration purposes” is junior. Please refer to the Prepare for Registration tile in your web account to verify your class standing for registration purposes. NOTE: Undergraduate In-season NCAA athletes may be assigned to an earlier class for registration. Please contact the Athletics Department if you have any questions about your status &/or time block. Undergraduate students with approved registration accommodations may be assigned to the first day of registration, contact SAS if you have questions. Honors Experience Program students may also be able to register beginning the first day of registration, contact your Honors Advisor if you have questions. A student may be going into their third year however if they did not take 4 units each semester &/or withdrew/failed a course, then they would register with the Sophomores. Enrollment Status Enrollment statuses are used to determine financial aid eligibility, loan deferment, FICA exemption, health insurance, and so on. After each term begins, enrollment statuses are reported to the National Student Clearinghouse several times in the semester to ensure that loan agencies have accurate and up-to-date enrollment information for you, as is required by federal regulations. Registration enrollment statuses and criteria are defined as follows: Enrollment Status Unit Criteria Full-time 3.00 and up Three-quarter time 1.75 to 2.75 Half-time 1.50 Less than half-time 0.25-1.25 Questions pertaining to the above definitions as they relate to financial aid or loan deferment, please contact Financial Assistance .

The University seeks to prepare students to meet the challenges of a complex and rapidly changing society. In students and faculty, Clark fosters a commitment to excellence in studying traditional academic disciplines, as well as innovation in exploring questions that cross disciplinary boundaries. The free pursuit of inquiry and the free exchange of ideas are central to that commitment. The focus of Clark’s academic program is a liberal-arts education enriched by interactions among undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty, and is closely linked to a select number of professional programs. Clark also serves students who wish to continue formal education throughout their lives. The intellectual and personal growth of students is enhanced by a wide variety of educational programs and extracurricular activities. Clark believes that intellectual growth must be accompanied by the development of values, the cultivation of responsible independence, and the appreciation of a range of perspectives. Clark’s academic community has long been distinguished by the pursuit of scientific inquiry and humanistic studies, enlivened by a concern for significant social issues. Among many other scholarly endeavors, Clark contributes to understanding human development, assessing relationships between people and the environment, and managing risk in a technological society. Clark is dedicated to being a dynamic community of learners able to thrive in today’s increasingly interrelated societies. The University maintains a national and international character, attracting high-caliber students and faculty from all quarters of the globe. As a university residing in an urban context, Clark also strives to address the needs and opportunities of contemporary urban life. Clark’s intimate academic setting and tradition of “elbow teaching” provide many opportunities for students to pursue knowledge through participation. High expectations, as well as easy access to the scholar-teacher faculty, encourage students to become autonomous learners. Clark’s international and interdisciplinary orientation is combined with a tradition of strong self-direction among students and faculty. These attributes enhance the University’s ability to contribute to the development of new modes of thought and to the advancement of society through the creation and transmission of knowledge.

The father of rocket science. The founder of the American Psychological Association. A co-inventor of the birth control pill. Members of our community have always challenged convention and found ways to change our world for the better. Letting Loose Before Finals Spree Day An evolving event since 1903, Clarkies let loose when classes are canceled one day each spring. Then it was rope pulls and greased pole climbs; now, it’s bounce houses, bands, and burgers.

In 1926, he launched a liquid-fueled rocket on his aunt’s farm in Auburn, earning him the moniker “Father of Modern Rocketry.” The first book on the moon When he stepped onto the moon in 1969, astronaut Buzz Aldrin carried with him two miniature autobiographies of Robert Goddard. He later gave a signed copy to Esther Goddard, the physicist’s widow, who donated the book to Clark’s library. Freud’s only lectures outside Europe Sigmund Freud presented his Clark lectures in 1909 as part of a series of conferences held in observance of the University’s 20th anniversary. It would be Freud’s only visit to America, and his only lectures outside of Europe. Paul Siple invented the wind chill In his doctoral research, Paul Siple, Ph.D. ’39, advanced the theory of wind chill and created an index to measure it — the wind chill factor. He later traveled seven times to Antarctica and named a mountain range there after Clark. Clark professor made Nobel Prize history In 1907, former Clark physics professor Albert Michelson became the first American awarded a Nobel Prize in the sciences for the development of the interferometer, an instrument designed to measure lengths and velocities of light. The birthplace of the Pill While a biology professor at Clark, Gregory Pincus conducted research paving the way for the birth control pill. He later founded the Worcester Foundation of Experimental Biology, which released the final version of the Pill to the public in 1960. TR addressed Clark’s first commencement President Theodore Roosevelt delivered the commencement address for Clark College’s first public undergraduate commencement ceremonies in 1905. Degrees were conferred on Clark’s class of 43 men. The ‘father of black psychology’ In 1920 African-American Francis Cecil Sumner earned a Ph.D. in psychology at Clark, becoming the first black person in the U.S. to earn a doctorate in that field. He would go on to found the department of psychology at Howard University. Commemorating a force of nature Heteropsyllus nunni , a minute crustacean inhabiting estuaries along the east coast of North America, was named for former biology professor Rudolph Nunnemacher. Both loved and feared by his students, he was one of Clark’s longest-serving professors. Rocking the stage at Clark Jimi Hendrix, The Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, Bruce Springsteen and James Taylor all performed at Clark. The Grateful Dead blew out the sound system. (It’s been fixed.)

Stanley Hall, the university opens its doors in Worcester, Massachusetts as the first graduate-study-only institution in the United States, with degrees offered in biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and psychology. Under Hall, its program in psychology becomes nationally competitive, a position it still holds. The university’s initial emphasis on groundbreaking research continues today through its academic departments, as well as the George Perkins Marsh Institute, Clark Labs, Strassler Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Mosakowski Institute for Public Enterprise, and the Hiatt Center for Urban Education. ··· 1887 A new university Massachusetts passes legislation incorporating Clark University.

Worcester Regional Airport : JetBlue, American, and Delta fly to several U.S. destinations. Take a taxi/ride-hailing service from the airport to Clark, about four miles. Other airports include Providence, R.I. , Manchester, N.H. , and Hartford, Conn. , but getting to Clark from these locations is often more complicated than from the Boston or Worcester airports. Getting to Clark from Boston: The cheap but indirect route Take a train or bus to Union Station in downtown Worcester, where you will need to take a taxi or ride-hailing service to get to Clark.

Many students use this option. Be sure to make reservations early and allow for travel time. The trip from Boston to Worcester can take more than an hour at peak travel times.

Worcester Regional Airport : JetBlue, American, and Delta fly to several U.S. destinations. Take a taxi/ride-hailing service from the airport to Clark, about four miles. Other airports include Providence, R.I. , Manchester, N.H. , and Hartford, Conn. , but getting to Clark from these locations is often more complicated than from the Boston or Worcester airports. Getting to Clark from Boston: The cheap but indirect route Take a train or bus to Union Station in downtown Worcester, where you will need to take a taxi or ride-hailing service to get to Clark. Getting to Clark from Boston: The direct but slightly more costly route Use a shared van/limousine service like Knights Limousine Service , to pick you up at Boston airport and bring you directly to campus. Many students use this option. Be sure to make reservations early and allow for travel time. The trip from Boston to Worcester can take more than an hour at peak travel times. This option is cheaper if you travel with a group. By Train Worcester’s Union Station is approximately three miles from campus.

We cultivate and nurture relationships with regional, national, and international media outlets to share the accomplishments, insights, and scholarship of the Clark community.

Media Resources Expert Sources Clark’s Rankings and Recognition Clark University at a Glance History of Clark University How We Help the Media Media Relations staff will be available to help you with the following and more: Locate and access interview sources such as Faculty Experts Arrange use of appropriate spaces, lighting, backdrops, props, etc. Find clear directions and help with parking arrangements Collect background information or official comment needed for accurate and balanced reporting. The safety, privacy, and unimpeded academic and extracurricular pursuits of Clark students, faculty, and staff are priorities. Residence halls and classrooms/labs are off-limits without prior arrangement through the Media Relations office. Commercial production companies and non-news related media are required to contact University Marketing and Communications before conducting business on campus. In the event of an emergency, the University administration and/or law enforcement or fire personnel can close the campus or areas on campus to the public, including members of media. In such a crisis, staff will work to arrange off-site or alternative ways to provide media outlets with accurate and up-to-date information. FOR FACULTY Share Your Expertise Why be a faculty expert? Serving as a resource for the media helps raise your profile and gives you an opportunity to plug your scholarship and/or funded research. Reporters are always looking for experts on a variety of topics to interview for their stories, and Clark’s Media Relations team is eager to promote the wide-ranging expertise of our faculty. We have tip sheets and best practices, so don’t be shy. Contact us today if you’re curious. We’d love for you to be part of the national conversation. How to work with Media Relations Clark’s Media Relations team has enjoyed great success publicizing Clark faculty news and our professors’ analysis of breaking news to high-profile journalists. Our team welcomes the opportunity to connect Clark experts to reporters who write for national and international media outlets on a variety of topics ranging from the effects of climate change on the Earth’s oceans to emerging adults’ views on love and marriage. If you expect news to break on a topic you follow, send us a brief (three to four sentences) analysis of the situation, a prediction about how events might unfold, or a pithy/controversial comment for us to share with the media as soon as possible after news breaks, and we’ll “pitch” your comment to interested journalists and encourage interviews. Because we are a small shop, we encourage you to contact us quickly and provide as much lead time as possible if you are interested in serving as a resource for the media; contact by email is usually best. The sooner you let us know about your forthcoming book or journal article, conference participation or presentation to lawmakers, the more prepared we will be to publicize your news in real-time. Thinking about setting up a blog or interested in learning more about social media? Contact us. Faculty who share their expertise with the press elevate the University’s reputation and help promote Clark to prospective students and their families worldwide. Alumni and friends of the University also report an added sense of pride when they see Clark faculty quoted in newspapers and in online outlets, or hear a Clark expert interviewed on the radio or on TV. The Media Relations staff is constantly reviewing queries from daily from hundreds of reporters looking to connect with faculty experts (typically on a tight deadline). If we discover a media opportunity that might be a match for your expertise, we present you with the opportunity to offer a comment, and at the same time try to be mindful of your busy schedule and classroom commitments.

Clark is anchored by a core of arts and sciences departments that include everything from biology to visual and performing arts. Atop this foundation, Clark adds the innovative transdisciplinary Department of Sustainability and Social Justice, which brings together faculty and students from multiple disciplines — all working to develop solutions to world challenges. Two additional schools complete our academic enterprise: the Graduate School of Business, which offers an undergraduate major and several master’s degrees, and the School of Professional Studies, which offers degrees and certificates for working professionals. Schools Undergraduate Arts and Sciences Clark’s undergraduate program in the arts and sciences provides an innovative liberal arts bachelor’s degree combining rigorous coursework with hands-on experiences that enable students to apply their knowledge to solve problems beyond the classroom. We call this Clark Core. Regardless of the discipline, Clark takes its students on a journey from theory to practice, classroom to the world. Clark students graduate with deeper critical thinking skills, a deeper understanding of other cultures and perspectives, and new ways of seeing and appreciating the natural world. Learn More Graduate Arts and Sciences As the first institution in the United States initially dedicated exclusively to graduate training and research, Clark University offers doctoral programs that have championed intellectual inquiry since the University’s founding in 1887. Today, Clark offers doctoral programs in biology, biochemistry, chemistry, economics, geography, history, physics, and psychology, and an M.A. in English and a master of arts in teaching (MAT). Clark’s division of Graduate Arts and Sciences flourishes as a close-knit community of more than 225 scholars in nine Ph.D. programs and two M.A. programs. Clark’s doctoral program in geography is top-ranked, and we have awarded more Ph.D.s in geography than any other institution. Our doctoral program in psychology is famous for its emphasis on culture and the social determinants of human well-being. And our unique program in Holocaust and Genocide Studies brings students from different disciplines together to study — and help prevent the reoccurrence of — some of humankind’s worst history. Our MAT program is nationally recognized for its success in strengthening educational outcomes in urban schools. In addition, Clark offers 14 accelerated degree programs that allow students to add a master’s degree onto their bachelor’s degree with only one additional year of work — and with free tuition for eligible students. Learn More Becker School of Design & Technology Featuring one of the world’s top five Game Design programs and top 10 Master of Fine Arts programs per The Princeton Review, the Becker School of Design & Technology provides students with a real-world studio environment to prepare them for lifelong careers in an exciting, rapidly changing industry. We also offer an accelerated master’s program, allowing students to obtain a B.A. in Interactive Media Design, then add a fifth year to pursue the MFA. Learn More School of Business As a business school based at a liberal arts university, the School of Business provides a rigorous business education focused on a human context. Lessons in ethics and corporate responsibility go hand in hand with accounting and finance — the common ground being leadership, vision, and success. Learn More School of Climate, Environment, and Society Opening in fall 2025, Clark’s new School of Climate, Environment, and Society is a bold and exciting response to the world’s most pressing call to action. The School builds on Clark’s long legacy of climate-related work in the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities — accelerating the discovery of human‑focused, community‑centered solutions. Learn More Department of Sustainability and Social Justice Clark’s Sustainability and Social Justice (formerly IDCE) is home to scholar-practitioners in passionate pursuit of solutions to the most pressing challenges facing individuals, communities, and the planet. We engage in translational, hands-on research that is inherently collaborative and uniquely effective.

Early Decision I and II are binding agreements —if admitted, you must enroll and withdraw other applications. Early Action Early Action is non-binding and allows first-year students to apply in the fall and receive their decision and financial aid award in January. Since you can apply Early Action to multiple colleges and universities, you’ll have more time and flexibility to explore all your options. Regular Decision Regular Decision is a non-binding decision round with an application deadline of January 15, and typical notification of our decisions in mid-to-late March. Transfer Applicants Clark welcomes transfer students from two- and four-year colleges. Each year, Clark welcomes about 75 new transfer students combined in the fall and spring semesters. Admissions deadlines are rolling each semester (see table). Submit transcripts, a faculty recommendation, and proof of good standing. Credit is granted for courses with a grade of C or higher. At least two years must be completed at Clark. International Applicants About 5% of Clark’s students come from outside the U.S. each year. If English is not your native language, you will need to submit an official TOEFL , Duolingo , or IELTS score report. We will consider your English proficiency holistically, based on your scores, transcript, essay, and letters of recommendation. We also strongly encourage all applicants to sit for an interview. This is especially important for applicants who do not speak English as a native language. Admissions for Spring Each year, Clark admits over 50 first-year and transfer students for spring admission. This term is becoming popular among first-year students who prefer to take a semester off or do a gap semester before starting college.

Over 95% of students receive some form of aid from Clark, either merit-based, need-based or both. Merit-based financial aid Merit-based financial aid or scholarships are based on your achievements, academic performance, and personal qualities. Some scholarships come from foundations, non-profits, governments, companies, and, of course, colleges and universities. Clark offers several different merit- and achievement-based scholarships. All applicants are automatically considered for these scholarships alongside your application to Clark. Clark merit scholarships Merit scholarships are based on your academic performance and potential, accomplishments and talents, and personal qualities you bring to Clark. You are automatically considered for Clark’s merit scholarships; there is no need for a separate application. Merit scholarship decisions are made without consideration of financial need. Presidential Scholarship The Presidential Scholarship is a highly esteemed scholarship awarded to approximately five exceptional students annually. It recognizes individuals who stand out due to their outstanding academic achievements and leadership potential, placing them among the top applicants to Clark. Private scholarships You may be eligible for additional scholarships offered by local, statewide, and national organizations. First year scholarships Need-based financial aid Need-based financial aid is offered to a student based on their family’s financial circumstances. Need-based aid can come in the form of institutional or government grants, which do not need to be repaid, or federal loans. Students must reapply for need-based aid annually. Apply for need-based aid early so that if you’re admitted to Clark, we can provide both your admission decision and financial aid offer at the same time. FAFSA US citizens, permanent residents, and eligible non-citizens submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Clark’s FAFSA code is 002139 , you’ll need that number.

We want to learn about what you love and what you are looking forward to learning. Come with a few questions.

Whether through athletics, family commitments, part-time jobs, or musicals, all experiences matter. Clark fosters an active and inclusive community; we value all ways of being engaged in your community and seek students who will learn from and with each other. We value the nice things others say about you Letters of recommendation help us understand who you are both in and out of the classroom. Your high school counselor provides one valuable prospective and teachers provide another. We suggest asking an academic teacher who knows you well to write a recommendation for you, someone who can speak to your strengths and growth as a student.

Schedule an interview Find your counselor Sign up for a campus visit According to our faculty Who thrives at Clark? “A curious student. A student who is willing to question their own beliefs, as well as everyone else’s.” “Interested in learning and growing, understands that learning and growing are as much their responsibility as ours.” “Not just someone who will study their books but someone who wants to engage in the community at large.” The waitlist What to do if you’re offered a spot on the waitlist If you are offered a spot on the waitlist, it’s important that you respond “yes” to remaining on the list. As space opens (including any financial aid we might be able to award), we look at the students who have actively said they are still interested in Clark by responding to our offer. We are typically able to offer a handful of students on the waitlist a spot in the first-year class every fall. If you are on the waitlist and very interested in Clark, please send your admissions counselor an email so they can make sure you are on the active “still interested” list. Frequently asked questions Is Clark test-optional? Yes. Clark University does not require students to submit either their SAT or ACT score as part of their application. Does your office have to receive my entire application by the deadline? Will you still review my application if some components are late? We strongly encourage you to submit all required materials by the deadline; however, we recognize it may not be possible in some cases. It’s most important that we receive your main application (either the Common App or the Coalition App with Scoir) by the deadline. Your other credentials may arrive after the deadline. You will be able to track your application materials in your applicant portal, and we’ll remind you by email of missing materials. If your application remains incomplete, it will be withdrawn, but only after we have attempted to notify you of what’s missing. It’s your responsibility to ensure your application is complete. Which application should I use, the Common Application or the Coalition Application with Scoir? You can apply using either application, and we do not have a preference which way you apply. Please submit only one application to Clark — you do not need to complete both! Neither application has a fee. How will I know when my application is complete? Once you’ve started your application, we’ll send you an email with information about how to log in to our applicant portal, and where you can check on the status of your materials, see what’s missing, and receive updates about your application. At peak periods around the deadlines, status updates on the portal are not immediate, so please allow for processing time. If you have questions about the status of your application, check your applicant portal, call 1-800-462-5275 or email our office . How will I be notified of Clark’s decision? All decisions are released through our applicant portal to your personal account, so you will be able to log in from anywhere to see your decision. You’ll receive credentials to sign in to this portal via email when we first receive your application materials. Note: We do not release admission decisions over the phone. Can I apply as a first-year student for spring admission? Yes, whether you are a U.S. citizens or an international student, you may apply as a first-year student for the spring semester. Follow the instructions for applying to Clark and submit your application by Nov. 1. Can I defer my enrollment if I am admitted via Regular Decision? Admitted students may postpone their enrollment for up to a year and must submit a request to defer in writing by May 1. A nonrefundable deposit (credited toward first-semester charges) is required. You cannot defer your enrollment at Clark if you intend to enroll in a degree-seeking program in the interim. Instead, you must reactivate your application and submit official transcripts for review. Can I receive Advanced Placement (AP) credit? Advanced Placement (AP) credit is defined as one unit of degree credit assigned for a score of 4 or 5 on a College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) AP exam taken after completion of an AP course and before the student formally matriculates. First-year students may receive credit for college work with grades of C or better completed prior to becoming a student at Clark University if that credit is in a content area deemed academically acceptable to Clark and is from an accredited college or university. First-year students may be awarded a maximum of eight units of credit (two semesters) for AP credit and/or credit from college courses taken while in high school.

Transfer applications received at the Undergraduate Admissions Office are only considered for full-time enrollment, which is typically four courses (4 Clark Units) per semester. If you want to apply for part-time or night classes, contact Clark’s School of Professional Studies . I have a bachelor’s degree already. Can I apply as a transfer applicant? You may apply as a transfer applicant, but no financial aid is awarded to students pursuing a second bachelor’s degree. For international transfer applicants, what is a foreign credential evaluation? International applicants applying for transfer admission from colleges and universities outside the United States must submit their academic records to a foreign credential evaluation service. This service provides information to assist in determining an applicant’s GPA relative to the American grading system, the transfer eligibility of university-level coursework, and the determination of class standing. When ordering a foreign credential evaluation, it must have a course-by-course analysis and show that the college or university is accredited in U.S. terms. Securing the evaluation and costs associated are your responsibility. An application without this evaluation will not be considered for admission. Is university housing available for transfer students? Yes! Clark students are required to live on campus up to the end of their sophomore year, and this is applicable to transfer students. Your transfer credit will determine your class standing. What if I didn’t do well in high school, but have improved with my college coursework? Your overall academic record is considered by Clark’s Admissions Committee, and improvements in academic performance from high school to college are taken into consideration. An upward trajectory in academic performance often indicates you learned the skills necessary to succeed at Clark. However, students who earned a GPA of less than 2.5 in high school must complete at least one full year of college courses (equivalent to 8 Clark Units) before being considered for admission.

Clark is anchored by a core of arts and sciences departments that include everything from biology to visual and performing arts. Atop this foundation, Clark adds the innovative transdisciplinary Department of Sustainability and Social Justice, which brings together faculty and students from multiple disciplines — all working to develop solutions to world challenges. Two additional schools complete our academic enterprise: the Graduate School of Business, which offers an undergraduate major and several master’s degrees, and the School of Professional Studies, which offers degrees and certificates for working professionals. Schools Undergraduate Arts and Sciences Clark’s undergraduate program in the arts and sciences provides an innovative liberal arts bachelor’s degree combining rigorous coursework with hands-on experiences that enable students to apply their knowledge to solve problems beyond the classroom. We call this Clark Core. Regardless of the discipline, Clark takes its students on a journey from theory to practice, classroom to the world. Clark students graduate with deeper critical thinking skills, a deeper understanding of other cultures and perspectives, and new ways of seeing and appreciating the natural world. Learn More Graduate Arts and Sciences As the first institution in the United States initially dedicated exclusively to graduate training and research, Clark University offers doctoral programs that have championed intellectual inquiry since the University’s founding in 1887. Today, Clark offers doctoral programs in biology, biochemistry, chemistry, economics, geography, history, physics, and psychology, and an M.A. in English and a master of arts in teaching (MAT). Clark’s division of Graduate Arts and Sciences flourishes as a close-knit community of more than 225 scholars in nine Ph.D. programs and two M.A. programs. Clark’s doctoral program in geography is top-ranked, and we have awarded more Ph.D.s in geography than any other institution. Our doctoral program in psychology is famous for its emphasis on culture and the social determinants of human well-being. And our unique program in Holocaust and Genocide Studies brings students from different disciplines together to study — and help prevent the reoccurrence of — some of humankind’s worst history. Our MAT program is nationally recognized for its success in strengthening educational outcomes in urban schools. In addition, Clark offers 14 accelerated degree programs that allow students to add a master’s degree onto their bachelor’s degree with only one additional year of work — and with free tuition for eligible students. Learn More Becker School of Design & Technology Featuring one of the world’s top five Game Design programs and top 10 Master of Fine Arts programs per The Princeton Review, the Becker School of Design & Technology provides students with a real-world studio environment to prepare them for lifelong careers in an exciting, rapidly changing industry. We also offer an accelerated master’s program, allowing students to obtain a B.A. in Interactive Media Design, then add a fifth year to pursue the MFA. Learn More School of Business As a business school based at a liberal arts university, the School of Business provides a rigorous business education focused on a human context. Lessons in ethics and corporate responsibility go hand in hand with accounting and finance — the common ground being leadership, vision, and success. Learn More School of Climate, Environment, and Society Opening in fall 2025, Clark’s new School of Climate, Environment, and Society is a bold and exciting response to the world’s most pressing call to action. The School builds on Clark’s long legacy of climate-related work in the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities — accelerating the discovery of human‑focused, community‑centered solutions. Learn More Department of Sustainability and Social Justice Clark’s Sustainability and Social Justice (formerly IDCE) is home to scholar-practitioners in passionate pursuit of solutions to the most pressing challenges facing individuals, communities, and the planet. We engage in translational, hands-on research that is inherently collaborative and uniquely effective.

With our small size, capacity for interdisciplinary learning, emphasis on effective practice, and engaged scholarship, we cultivate an environment uniquely supportive of students’ interests and ambitions. Our urban location and tradition of community partnerships place Clark faculty and students in an ideal position to boldly exemplify the University’s motto, “Challenge Convention. Change Our World.” Students come to Clark with the passion to make a difference, and we honor that passion by engaging them intensely with the world in all its diversity and complexity, enabling them to become more globally aware, focused, and prepared to act. Located in the second largest city in New England - Worcester, Massachusetts - Clark enrolls approximately 2,300 undergraduate and 1,500 graduate students. Undergraduate Studies Clark University offers more than 45 undergraduate majors and major tracks, along with an accelerated B.A./master’s degree program with the fifth year of study tuition-free, or with reduced tuition, for qualified students. Nationally renowned as a college that changes lives, Clark is emerging as a transformative force in higher education today. Graduate Studies Clark’s focused areas of research excellence are backed by strong doctoral, and master’s degree programs as well as graduate certificate programs - in the arts and sciences, School of Business (CUSB), Department of Sustainability and Social Justice (SSJ), School of Professional Studies (SPS), and Becker School of Design & Technology (BSDT) - that engage graduate students from around the world. Our academic programs, research centers, and institutes, along with our emphasis on engaged scholarship generate findings and insights that directly benefit the communities we serve. Clark students graduate with the capacity to lead effectively, manage responsibly, advance knowledge, and make significant contributions to their workplaces, communities, and the world. The American Language and Culture Institute offers intensive English as a Second Language (ESL) and academic pathway programs for students who want to improve their English-language skills. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Clark University embraces equal opportunity as a core value: We believe that cultivating an environment that embraces and promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion is fundamental to the success of our students, our employees, and our community. This commitment applies to every aspect of education, services, and employment policies and practices at Clark and informs our efforts in recruitment, hiring, and retention. All members of the Clark community share in the responsibility for shaping an environment that values difference and promotes fairness and belonging by exhibiting integrity and respect when we interact with one another.

Submit Search Query Courses and Schedules Academic Catalog Academic Calendars Transcripts Students Faculty/Advisor Courses and Schedules Academic Catalog Academic Calendars Transcripts Students Faculty/Advisor Courses and Schedules Home Courses and Schedules Clark University students web register through the CUWeb portal. Course offerings are published at the start of advising each semester. Select the semester below for course schedules, registration dates, and final exam periods. Additional information such as the Academic Calendar, Academic Catalog, and Web Registration Instructions are included within the Registrar’s Office website. Many classroom spaces are viewable online along with a list of their Software by navigating to the ITS webpage . Class Standing Current class level for undergraduate students is calculated by the number of units earned. 0-7.99 units completed = First Year class standing 8-15.99 units completed = Sophomore class standing 16-23.99 units completed = Junior class standing 24 or more units = Senior class standing Online registration priority dates for undergraduate students(Fall & Spring), however, are determined by the student’s anticipated class as of the next semester, which includes BOTH earned units and currently registered units. For example, if a student has 12 earned units (current sophomore class) and is registered for 4 units this semester (total of 16), then that student’s anticipated class for the next semester is junior. Thus, the student’s “class for registration purposes” is junior. Please refer to the Prepare for Registration tile in your web account to verify your class standing for registration purposes. NOTE: Undergraduate In-season NCAA athletes may be assigned to an earlier class for registration. Please contact the Athletics Department if you have any questions about your status &/or time block. Undergraduate students with approved registration accommodations may be assigned to the first day of registration, contact SAS if you have questions. Honors Experience Program students may also be able to register beginning the first day of registration, contact your Honors Advisor if you have questions. A student may be going into their third year however if they did not take 4 units each semester &/or withdrew/failed a course, then they would register with the Sophomores. Enrollment Status Enrollment statuses are used to determine financial aid eligibility, loan deferment, FICA exemption, health insurance, and so on. After each term begins, enrollment statuses are reported to the National Student Clearinghouse several times in the semester to ensure that loan agencies have accurate and up-to-date enrollment information for you, as is required by federal regulations. Registration enrollment statuses and criteria are defined as follows: Enrollment Status Unit Criteria Full-time 3.00 and up Three-quarter time 1.75 to 2.75 Half-time 1.50 Less than half-time 0.25-1.25 Questions pertaining to the above definitions as they relate to financial aid or loan deferment, please contact Financial Assistance .

I've made some of the best connections during my time here — with friends, professors, coaches, staff, and alumni. Rachael Chen Basketball player; political science major Playing sports at Clark has helped me to grow both as a student and as a person. I have become more independent, self-reliant, and highly motivated. Olivia Barksdale Field hockey and softball player; environmental science major The concept of 'team' is important here, especially the way younger players learn from the older players. My Clark experience has been great, and I credit my team for that.

If you see a bunch of students on the green dancing, eating, and playing on inflatable slides, you know it’s that time of year. The campus also turns out for Midnight Mayhem basketball in the fall, International Gala in the spring, and plenty of student, academic, and research events in between. To cap it all off: Commencement and Reunion in May. October Family and Friends Weekend Fall is a great time to enjoy New England. Families and friends visit with students, enjoy activities and special events, and connect with other Clarkies. October and April ClarkFEST Clark undergraduates present their research and creative work twice a year, at ClarkFEST in October and April. March/April International Gala The International Student Association organizes International Gala every year, with students from all over campus contributing their song and dance talents. April Spree Day Started in 1903, Spree Day — when classes are canceled and students enjoy a fun-filled day right before finals — is one of the most beloved traditions at Clark. April Graduate Student Multidisciplinary Conference This conference highlights the important scholarship produced by Clark’s talented graduate student community. May Commencement Undergraduate and graduate students step to the podium to receive their diplomas, and celebrate their achievements with family and friends.

Clark is anchored by a core of arts and sciences departments that include everything from biology to visual and performing arts. Atop this foundation, Clark adds the innovative transdisciplinary Department of Sustainability and Social Justice, which brings together faculty and students from multiple disciplines — all working to develop solutions to world challenges. Two additional schools complete our academic enterprise: the Graduate School of Business, which offers an undergraduate major and several master’s degrees, and the School of Professional Studies, which offers degrees and certificates for working professionals. Schools Undergraduate Arts and Sciences Clark’s undergraduate program in the arts and sciences provides an innovative liberal arts bachelor’s degree combining rigorous coursework with hands-on experiences that enable students to apply their knowledge to solve problems beyond the classroom. We call this Clark Core. Regardless of the discipline, Clark takes its students on a journey from theory to practice, classroom to the world. Clark students graduate with deeper critical thinking skills, a deeper understanding of other cultures and perspectives, and new ways of seeing and appreciating the natural world. Learn More Graduate Arts and Sciences As the first institution in the United States initially dedicated exclusively to graduate training and research, Clark University offers doctoral programs that have championed intellectual inquiry since the University’s founding in 1887. Today, Clark offers doctoral programs in biology, biochemistry, chemistry, economics, geography, history, physics, and psychology, and an M.A. in English and a master of arts in teaching (MAT). Clark’s division of Graduate Arts and Sciences flourishes as a close-knit community of more than 225 scholars in nine Ph.D. programs and two M.A. programs. Clark’s doctoral program in geography is top-ranked, and we have awarded more Ph.D.s in geography than any other institution. Our doctoral program in psychology is famous for its emphasis on culture and the social determinants of human well-being. And our unique program in Holocaust and Genocide Studies brings students from different disciplines together to study — and help prevent the reoccurrence of — some of humankind’s worst history. Our MAT program is nationally recognized for its success in strengthening educational outcomes in urban schools. In addition, Clark offers 14 accelerated degree programs that allow students to add a master’s degree onto their bachelor’s degree with only one additional year of work — and with free tuition for eligible students. Learn More Becker School of Design & Technology Featuring one of the world’s top five Game Design programs and top 10 Master of Fine Arts programs per The Princeton Review, the Becker School of Design & Technology provides students with a real-world studio environment to prepare them for lifelong careers in an exciting, rapidly changing industry. We also offer an accelerated master’s program, allowing students to obtain a B.A. in Interactive Media Design, then add a fifth year to pursue the MFA. Learn More School of Business As a business school based at a liberal arts university, the School of Business provides a rigorous business education focused on a human context. Lessons in ethics and corporate responsibility go hand in hand with accounting and finance — the common ground being leadership, vision, and success. Learn More School of Climate, Environment, and Society Opening in fall 2025, Clark’s new School of Climate, Environment, and Society is a bold and exciting response to the world’s most pressing call to action. The School builds on Clark’s long legacy of climate-related work in the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities — accelerating the discovery of human‑focused, community‑centered solutions. Learn More Department of Sustainability and Social Justice Clark’s Sustainability and Social Justice (formerly IDCE) is home to scholar-practitioners in passionate pursuit of solutions to the most pressing challenges facing individuals, communities, and the planet. We engage in translational, hands-on research that is inherently collaborative and uniquely effective.

With our small size, capacity for interdisciplinary learning, emphasis on effective practice, and engaged scholarship, we cultivate an environment uniquely supportive of students’ interests and ambitions. Our urban location and tradition of community partnerships place Clark faculty and students in an ideal position to boldly exemplify the University’s motto, “Challenge Convention. Change Our World.” Students come to Clark with the passion to make a difference, and we honor that passion by engaging them intensely with the world in all its diversity and complexity, enabling them to become more globally aware, focused, and prepared to act. Located in the second largest city in New England - Worcester, Massachusetts - Clark enrolls approximately 2,300 undergraduate and 1,500 graduate students. Undergraduate Studies Clark University offers more than 45 undergraduate majors and major tracks, along with an accelerated B.A./master’s degree program with the fifth year of study tuition-free, or with reduced tuition, for qualified students. Nationally renowned as a college that changes lives, Clark is emerging as a transformative force in higher education today. Graduate Studies Clark’s focused areas of research excellence are backed by strong doctoral, and master’s degree programs as well as graduate certificate programs - in the arts and sciences, School of Business (CUSB), Department of Sustainability and Social Justice (SSJ), School of Professional Studies (SPS), and Becker School of Design & Technology (BSDT) - that engage graduate students from around the world. Our academic programs, research centers, and institutes, along with our emphasis on engaged scholarship generate findings and insights that directly benefit the communities we serve. Clark students graduate with the capacity to lead effectively, manage responsibly, advance knowledge, and make significant contributions to their workplaces, communities, and the world. The American Language and Culture Institute offers intensive English as a Second Language (ESL) and academic pathway programs for students who want to improve their English-language skills. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Clark University embraces equal opportunity as a core value: We believe that cultivating an environment that embraces and promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion is fundamental to the success of our students, our employees, and our community. This commitment applies to every aspect of education, services, and employment policies and practices at Clark and informs our efforts in recruitment, hiring, and retention. All members of the Clark community share in the responsibility for shaping an environment that values difference and promotes fairness and belonging by exhibiting integrity and respect when we interact with one another.

Submit Search Query Courses and Schedules Academic Catalog Academic Calendars Transcripts Students Faculty/Advisor Courses and Schedules Academic Catalog Academic Calendars Transcripts Students Faculty/Advisor Courses and Schedules Home Courses and Schedules Clark University students web register through the CUWeb portal. Course offerings are published at the start of advising each semester. Select the semester below for course schedules, registration dates, and final exam periods. Additional information such as the Academic Calendar, Academic Catalog, and Web Registration Instructions are included within the Registrar’s Office website. Many classroom spaces are viewable online along with a list of their Software by navigating to the ITS webpage . Class Standing Current class level for undergraduate students is calculated by the number of units earned. 0-7.99 units completed = First Year class standing 8-15.99 units completed = Sophomore class standing 16-23.99 units completed = Junior class standing 24 or more units = Senior class standing Online registration priority dates for undergraduate students(Fall & Spring), however, are determined by the student’s anticipated class as of the next semester, which includes BOTH earned units and currently registered units. For example, if a student has 12 earned units (current sophomore class) and is registered for 4 units this semester (total of 16), then that student’s anticipated class for the next semester is junior. Thus, the student’s “class for registration purposes” is junior. Please refer to the Prepare for Registration tile in your web account to verify your class standing for registration purposes. NOTE: Undergraduate In-season NCAA athletes may be assigned to an earlier class for registration. Please contact the Athletics Department if you have any questions about your status &/or time block. Undergraduate students with approved registration accommodations may be assigned to the first day of registration, contact SAS if you have questions. Honors Experience Program students may also be able to register beginning the first day of registration, contact your Honors Advisor if you have questions. A student may be going into their third year however if they did not take 4 units each semester &/or withdrew/failed a course, then they would register with the Sophomores. Enrollment Status Enrollment statuses are used to determine financial aid eligibility, loan deferment, FICA exemption, health insurance, and so on. After each term begins, enrollment statuses are reported to the National Student Clearinghouse several times in the semester to ensure that loan agencies have accurate and up-to-date enrollment information for you, as is required by federal regulations. Registration enrollment statuses and criteria are defined as follows: Enrollment Status Unit Criteria Full-time 3.00 and up Three-quarter time 1.75 to 2.75 Half-time 1.50 Less than half-time 0.25-1.25 Questions pertaining to the above definitions as they relate to financial aid or loan deferment, please contact Financial Assistance .

Submit Search Query Courses and Schedules Academic Catalog Academic Calendars Transcripts Students Faculty/Advisor Courses and Schedules Academic Catalog Academic Calendars Transcripts Students Faculty/Advisor Courses and Schedules Home Courses and Schedules Clark University students web register through the CUWeb portal. Course offerings are published at the start of advising each semester. Select the semester below for course schedules, registration dates, and final exam periods. Additional information such as the Academic Calendar, Academic Catalog, and Web Registration Instructions are included within the Registrar’s Office website. Many classroom spaces are viewable online along with a list of their Software by navigating to the ITS webpage . Class Standing Current class level for undergraduate students is calculated by the number of units earned. 0-7.99 units completed = First Year class standing 8-15.99 units completed = Sophomore class standing 16-23.99 units completed = Junior class standing 24 or more units = Senior class standing Online registration priority dates for undergraduate students(Fall & Spring), however, are determined by the student’s anticipated class as of the next semester, which includes BOTH earned units and currently registered units. For example, if a student has 12 earned units (current sophomore class) and is registered for 4 units this semester (total of 16), then that student’s anticipated class for the next semester is junior. Thus, the student’s “class for registration purposes” is junior. Please refer to the Prepare for Registration tile in your web account to verify your class standing for registration purposes. NOTE: Undergraduate In-season NCAA athletes may be assigned to an earlier class for registration. Please contact the Athletics Department if you have any questions about your status &/or time block. Undergraduate students with approved registration accommodations may be assigned to the first day of registration, contact SAS if you have questions. Honors Experience Program students may also be able to register beginning the first day of registration, contact your Honors Advisor if you have questions. A student may be going into their third year however if they did not take 4 units each semester &/or withdrew/failed a course, then they would register with the Sophomores. Enrollment Status Enrollment statuses are used to determine financial aid eligibility, loan deferment, FICA exemption, health insurance, and so on. After each term begins, enrollment statuses are reported to the National Student Clearinghouse several times in the semester to ensure that loan agencies have accurate and up-to-date enrollment information for you, as is required by federal regulations. Registration enrollment statuses and criteria are defined as follows: Enrollment Status Unit Criteria Full-time 3.00 and up Three-quarter time 1.75 to 2.75 Half-time 1.50 Less than half-time 0.25-1.25 Questions pertaining to the above definitions as they relate to financial aid or loan deferment, please contact Financial Assistance .

Clark University’s game design programs have once again been ranked among the best in the world. Clark’s undergraduate program is ranked No. 3 on The Princeton Review’s Top 50 Schools for Game Design nationwide and beyond, while the master of fine arts program is No. 5 on the list of Top 25 Graduate Schools for Game Design . Both the undergraduate and graduate programs, which are offered through the Becker School of Design & Technology , are ranked No. 2 in the Northeast. “Clark University’s Game Design and Development program is ranked among the top in the world by the Princeton Review for good reason,” says Paul Cotnoir, dean of the Becker School of Design & Technology. “Clark’s world-class faculty, cutting-edge curriculum, incredible facilities, and strong industry connections help prepare its students for world-changing careers in interactive media. “Clark is unique among game design schools in that it integrates game design with business, data science, psychology, and social impact fields like climate change and urban studies, offering a truly interdisciplinary learning experience.” The Princeton Review chose schools for the 2025 lists based on a 2024 survey of administrators at 150 institutions in the U.S. and abroad. The survey requested information in four areas: academics, faculty, technology, and career prospects. More than 40 survey data points were considered to determine the school selections and tally the rankings. Visit The Princeton Review’s website for more information about the survey and ranking methodology . The Princeton Review developed this ranking category in 2010 with guidance from a national advisory board formed to help design the project survey and methodology. Advisory board members included administrators and faculty from respected game design programs, as well as professionals from some of the top video game companies. Study game design at Clark Summer Game Studio Kickstart your design journey, develop new skills, and make your own game at a two-week game design program that immerses pre-college students in the Becker School of Design & Technology. Students will learn all aspects of game design and development from the same faculty who have helped the BSDT’s undergraduate program earn The Princeton Review’s No. 3 ranking.

The noise of churning ship propellers. Indigenous black metal. A Roy Orbison tune. To Clark environmental geographer Max Ritts , “sound is an uncertain object, a riddle in a way, that’s potentially positive or potentially negative in its uses.” It’s a point he drives home in his 2024 book, A Resonant Ecology , which explores the ever-evolving sonic landscape of British Columbia’s North Coast and local Indigenous communities’ response to encroaching development and environmental change. Geography Professor Max Ritts (photo by Steven King) Ritts’ research for the book began during his Ph.D. program in geography at the University of British Columbia around 2011, as he witnessed protests against oil and gas shipping linked to Alberta’s tar sands, which environmentalists and First Nations feared would impact wildlife and communities around British Columbia’s coast. “There was this sense that this part of the coast was to be a ‘ground zero’ for an environmental struggle — which it would become — because there was all this opposition to Enbridge, the pipeline company that was proposing to ship tar sands oil,” according to Ritts, assistant professor in the Graduate School of Geography , part of the School of Climate, Environment, and Society . “There also were liquefied natural gas projects, which were slated to happen in the area. And then there was an Indigenous resurgence, all these Nations saying, ‘If you want to pursue these development projects, they will proceed on our terms, not through the directives of companies in Vancouver or the Bay Area.’ ” In a recent interview, Ritts delved into themes of his book and described what he learned from conservation scientists on Gil Island studying whale sounds, and from former members of a black metal band in the Gitga’at First Nation — each entrained in different ways to “noise” as a sonic expression of increased industrialization. What inspired you to research the connections between ecology and sound? I started my research focus on the tar sands, this mega oil project in Alberta, and I was interested in the terminus of one of the proposed pipelines, which was to go through the North Coast by shipping. It would stop at a place called Kitimat (in British Columbia), but then the oil would be loaded onto ships that would bisect these very delicate coastal ecologies which are in the Gitga’at . In 2012, I first visited a whale research station (Cetacea Lab) that was conducting scientific research in anticipation of the impacts of that shipping activity. They had determined that a lot of ships transiting the coastline would affect the whale populations negatively through the production of ocean noise. I was amazed that they were doing all this listening. It introduced me to the idea that I might study this entire region through sound. Many of the complications I was witnessing — the economic transformations, the expected environmental transformations, but also the ongoing environmental transformations due to climate change, and the Indigenous resurgence responding to these and much deeper transformations — were passing through the medium of sound. What are the impacts of human-produced sounds on whales? When ship propellers turn, they create thousands of bubbles that collapse in the water and create this droning sound that really affects humpback whales and killer whales, but also fin whales and, further offshore, grey whales and other animals. All sorts of marine life get impacted. In species like humpback whales, their own calls get interfered with. It’s called masking. The sound of the ship doesn’t allow them to communicate properly with their conspecifics. In other species, whales have been known to beach themselves in response to other kinds of noise sources like military sonar. We suspect that there are damages to the whales’ eardrums and hearing abilities over long periods of time. This has been studied with lower-frequency shipping noise, and in other contexts through high-frequency sonar. The science is still emerging, but there’s loads of work now suggesting an ever-wider range of impacts on species that depend vitally on calling and listening as part of the way they live in the ocean.

I was interested in the North Coast for its long legacy of resource extraction and the resistance to it. There is industrial whaling — resource extraction — on the one hand, but also various kinds of cultural extractions, such as “salvage ethnography” — a legacy through which early anthropologists visiting the coast at the turn of the last century recorded traditional practices and took objects to “preserve” Indigenous cultures they thought would be lost to “progress.” So there’s a legacy of extraction via sound, historically, within the Nations, as well as extraction of animal lives and other kinds of resources in terms of whaling and logging and mineral extraction. The coast has this colonial legacy, which is absolutely essential to the way in which I tried to do my work ethically, and which also figures in how I understood the present phase of development as a layering of political and economic forces. What type of songs were extracted? In the book, I refer to one of Marius Barbeau’s essays, “Songs of the Northwest,” written in 1933, where he talks about how the Western musical notation and the Western stave (or staff, with five horizontal, parallel lines where composers write musical notes) can be likened to “a rack on which to pin down sounds.” You’re capturing these sounds and placing them in another context — a western institutional idiom. That idea of “possessiveness” is one of the throughlines of my book. There’s a certain possessive logic in the way that sounds will be encountered on the coast today, as there was over a century ago. Even the whale sounds — which are ostensibly a means of broadcasting support for the plight of the whales — will become a basis for other kinds of profit-making activities that will continue in that possessive logic, and in ways that can harm the conduct of whale research. Against this legacy, there’s a lot of work now being done by Indigenous anthropologists and sociologists — including Robin Gray, a Ts’msyen anthropologist in Toronto — called rematriation (an Indigenous feminist reading of “repatriation”). And what they’re referring to are traditional songs about important community activities or harvesting activities, or creation myths that would have been written down or taken by anthropologists such as Claude Lévi Strauss, Franz Boas, and, especially, Marius Barbeau, who produced this huge trove of work about the Northwest Coast. Can you talk about the music that is present in your book — the Indigenous black metal band and country music, co-existing within the Gitga’at First Nation? One chapter in the book deals with my relationship with two cousins from the Nation, Spencer Greening and Jeremy Paul. They were in this incredible black metal band, Gyibaaw, for a few years. Their music was joyful and funny and noisy, and it was also very important to the way that they were seeing and interpreting all the economic and environmental changes, and how they were capturing and expressing their identity as Ts’msyen, as Indigenous people, through music. After they disbanded Gyibaaw in 2012, they started an old-time country music band, The Saltwater Brothers. Their grandfather, Johnny Paul, was a country musician and used to ride the Canadian National Railway singing to people. (Jeremy played at Clark last year under the name “Saltwater Hank.”) Both country and metal music have this kind of cross-cultural history. They’re not just so-called “white” or “Western” music; they’re also significantly informed by Indigenous people. Robbie Robertson and Hank Williams are two examples. And then there’s all sorts of black metal history as well — Indigenous bands in Brazil and Colombia were really influential to the formation of that genre. Spencer and Jeremy drawing on these traditions is not an accident; these music genres have always had Indigenous presences in them. In many ways, what we call Western music is significantly informed by communities who don’t get the full appreciation that they deserve. How are the whale sounds and the Indigenous music connected? In my book, I consider how both of these sounds — the black metal sounds and the whale sounds — are echoing out from the territory at a time of industrial development, how they are linked to development if not completely “captured” by it. And not only are the sounds echoing out, they’re being interpreted by others in this development context, too. People are listening to them as signs of what may happen or what should happen, they are forming meanings and associations — of an industrial devastation that may be unleashed upon whales, for instance, or a cultural resurgence that may constitute new expressions of Indigenous sovereignty. And so they’re both connected that way. Interestingly, whale sounds and Indigenous also both connected in terms of noise. The history of the receptions of those musics has involved them being denigrated and disregarded as noise by certain interlocutors. In the 1950s, naval scientists treated whale sounds as noise, before scientists like Roger Payne recognized them as song. And early explorers of the North Coast regarded Indigenous music as guttural, primitive sound, and noisy, something that continued with early anthropologists who compared it to classical music and didn’t like what they heard. Only much later would they recognize its complexity. Certain kinds of displays were defined as nonsensical or meaningless, as “just an animal sound or a howl.” And it may very well have been a howl, but it also may have, within that howl, also been a story of connection to a territory, or of relatedness to an animal kin. What do you want people to take away from your book? I hope the book stands as an affirmation of this incredible part of the world, the North Coast, for all the histories that define it, for all the communities that live there and make it an amazing place. I hope that the book captures something of the uniqueness of the coast — the whales and the nature and histories that exist nowhere else. The argument of the book is that sound not only provides a unique and enduring way of understanding these transformations for all the communities — and how those communities respond to development projects — but that sound is oftentimes an opaque and uncertain guide. We don’t listen enough; sound can be a more authentic way of being in the world. But it’s also true that sound can be enrolled in all sorts of projects of social control. And we see that especially today with smart technologies and surveillance technologies that use sound to track people and animals and dominate their social relationships through algorithmic means. Alongside industrial change, the book also follows that throughline — not only do we see industrial development redefine the coast and its politics, but also digitalization. This was not something I expected when I started the research. By 2018, when I finished my fieldwork, it was evident that digitalization was defining how the coast was to be governed for a range of communities with an impact on a range of different kinds of life ways. And these governance changes involved digital music and digital sound. What does the future hold for the North Coast? The global demand for energy already has opened the region to new shipping projects and new kinds of oil and gas projects, making a mockery of government claims to sustainable development or the precautionary principle , for which scientists would advocate because this is an extremely delicate ecology. We don’t know what the long-term impacts of ocean noise will be, let alone of warming ocean waters which, for First Nations communities, affected seasonality and literally changed the taste of seaweed. There is more industrial development on its way, and there are huge risks with those projects, environmental risks and economic disruptions. Alongside, there is more marine governance operating through digital means — smart governance systems that are meant to steer and protect nature as these projects take shape. In one of the book chapters, I discuss the impact of those digitally mediated, smart governance systems that purport to be managing everything sustainably but depend on things that we don’t know will be guaranteed in the future, like endless supplies of data, for example. And they convert vocal sounds into data, and they convert noise into data. And we don’t yet know if those projects will deliver on the things that they say they will, like predictive analytics or real-time regulation, but there are reasons to be suspicious. What’s next in your research? I’m looking at the new markets emerging around environmental sensor technologies in mining and oil and gas. Sensors are becoming increasingly important in mineral extraction, in underground mining and also in offshore oil. You have individual projects with literally tens of thousands of sensors trying to make sense of these incredibly hostile, almost inhuman, environments. I’m focusing on Sudbury, Ontario, which has some of the deepest mines in the world. It also has unique geology, a lot of unique mineral wealth because a meteorite landed there, and now all this new proposed activity around smart mining. And these sensors are important for accessing super-deep mining locations and making decisions about what to extract and how. I’m excited about digging into it, no pun intended.

Change. Podcast The evolution of LinkedIn How internet influencers have changed the professional networking platform February 6, 2025 By Brenna Moore ’24, MSC '25 Lawrence Norman Is online influencing just for entertainment? Or does it have a place in the business world? LinkedIn has been a networking platform since 2002, but lately, it has evolved into something more. So-called LinkedInfluencers are using the platform in the same vein as other social media sites, injecting inspiration into their posts to boost their personal brands and shape conversations about their industries. On this episode of Challenge. Change. , Professors Lawrence Norman and Tim Hally ’19, MBA ’20, who teach marketing at Clark’s School of Business, weigh in on whether this kind of content is beneficial and share how one can develop their personal brand messaging to cut through the online clutter to form genuine connections. Tim Hally “LinkedIn has evolved from a work and internship job hub to a place to post entertainment that’s linked to work,” Norman says. “It’s become a powerful space where you’re able to promote your brand in a way that you couldn’t years ago.” Hally says he does consider himself a LinkedInfluencer, but is cautious and thoughtful with his posts. He wants to avoid the negative connotations associated with online influencing. “I think personal branding really is an exercise of self-awareness,” he says. “Personal branding is this conscious long-term activity of projecting thoughts, ideas, values, and experiences out into the world. We cannot control what people think of us, but we can help own our narrative, we can help shape that perception, and we can take our power back.” Challenge.

# Page 154: Congratulations Jeffrey Lurie ’73, owner of the Philadelphia Eagles - Boston native Jeffrey Lurie '73 helps the Eagles fly - Clark Now | Clark University
Boston native Jeffrey Lurie '73 helps the Eagles fly - Clark Now | Clark University Skip to content Clark University Media Relations Suggest a Story Toggle main menu Topics All Stories In the News Expert Sources Podcasts Resources Info For Media Relations Suggest a Story Enter a search query Submit Search Query Open Search Bar Close Search Bar Boston native Jeffrey Lurie ’73 helps the Eagles fly February 7, 2025 By Jim Keogh Editor’s note: As the Super Bowl approaches, Clark is rooting for alum Jeffrey Lurie ’73, owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, who are taking on the Kansas City Chiefs in the big game. We are republishing this fall 2013 CLARK magazine profile of Lurie, which describes his journey from Boston kid and Clark undergrad to the highest echelons of the NFL. The mayor was on the line, welcoming Jeffrey Lurie ’73 to town as the new owner of the Philadelphia Eagles , when a rat skittered across Lurie’s office floor. As omens go, it was a doozy. Things didn’t get better the next morning when The Wall Street Journal ran a front page story taking Lurie to task for overpaying for the franchise — a then-record $185 million — and for making the purchase based on the heat of emotion rather than cold analysis. The numbers just did not add up, the paper insisted. It was early May 1994. As Lurie sat in that basement office in Veterans Stadium, a dismal facility widely regarded as one of the worst in the National Football League, he pondered the newspaper’s admonition. “I wasn’t self-confident enough to think they weren’t right,” he recalls with a laugh. But Lurie knew something his critics didn’t. He had approached this business deal methodically, studying the figures, poring over the projections, and extracting sentiment from the equation before pulling the trigger — something he would do time and again in the succeeding years. And there was one more thing, his personal wild card, so to speak. Lurie was entering the NFL as a second career. His first had been in the film industry, which helped him assess his newly chosen profession in a unique light. He saw the NFL games as hit movies playing to eager audiences every weekend, and as the number of avenues to distribute the product was multiplying, the potential for an explosion in football’s popularity loomed on the horizon. Paid too much? Lurie was figuring the team had been undervalued. That rat in his office was not a premonition of doom. It was a call to action to rebuild a proud franchise that had fallen on hard times and catch the wave he believed was forming. Jeffrey Lurie ’73 greets fellow alumni at the Jonas Clark Fellows event during Reunion Weekend. Jeff Lurie stood at the podium in Tilton Hall on May 17 and told the Reunion Weekend audience who’d come to hear him speak that Clark University represented a reversal of the rigid prep school education he’d received. “At Clark, it wasn’t just a professor determining what the paradigms of the moment were,” he said. “I didn’t want to hear the paradigms as they existed; a lot of us wanted to hear the paradigms of what could be. That notion infused me with a lot of energy to go after things that others would say were conventionally unrealistic.” In a recent interview, Lurie remembered that Clark’s emphasis on emotional intelligence and critical thinking “liberated what was inside of me and allowed me to flourish.” “What I really respect and value about my time at Clark was that the school focused on empowering students to explore and not be fixated on any rigid form of analysis, but really be open to the world around them,” he says. “Clark wasn’t what was important — the student was important.” Days were for class; the nights included trips to El Morocco, the Miss Worcester diner and any of the dozens of rock and folk shows that passed through Worcester and Boston (sometimes with stops at Clark). A Grateful Dead fanatic, Lurie followed the band across New England whenever it swung through the Northeast. The Boston native was fervent about his hometown sports teams to the point where he would sleep overnight outside of Boston Garden to snag tickets for obstructed-view seats to Bruins games. When the Celtics reached the playoffs, he and his Clark buddies camped outside the Ticketron office in the parking lot of the Auburn Mall to be the first in line for tickets. “I got to know the lady in charge there,” he recalls. “She was very helpful.” Lurie graduated from Clark with a degree in psychology , earned his master’s at Boston University and his Ph.D. in social policy from Brandeis. Though he enjoyed a stint teaching at B.U., he had no interest in becoming an academic. His two loves were sports and movies, and a career that didn’t involve either of them simply was unthinkable. Shortly after earning his doctorate, Lurie joined the family business, General Cinema Corp. The company was founded in 1935 by Lurie’s grandfather, Philip Smith, and at its peak could boast of being the largest movie theater chain in the country. “My grandfather came up with the concept of opening a movie theater in a shopping mall in the suburbs, which was unheard of in those days,” Lurie says. “People would go to the city for entertainment, and suburbs were just places to live. He built the first cinema in a shopping mall in America — at Shoppers’ World in Framingham [Mass.] — and at first nobody showed up because the concept was so new. He brought in stars of the day like Mae West and Marlon Brando to perform live on weekends so people would realize that there could actually be entertainment in the suburbs.” Lurie dove in. As the company’s liaison to the Hollywood studios, he learned the mechanics of production, distribution and finances. Cable TV channels like HBO and Showtime were appearing on the scene and altering the industry’s dynamics, and movie companies were forced to adjust. Within a few years, Lurie, tired of the movie exhibitor side of the business, left the company to form Chestnut Hill Productions and produce his own movies in Los Angeles. “I’d gotten to know a lot of top Hollywood executives through my job at General Cinema and it was a natural move for me,” he says. “I’d become less interested in the movie theater business and more interested in what kinds of movies you could make.” As another learning experience, his time in Hollywood was invaluable. He gained an intimate understanding of the movie and TV industry while producing a number of feature films from the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, including “I Love You to Death” with Kevin Kline, “Blind Side” with Rebecca De Mornay, and “Foxfire,” starring a then-unknown Angelina Jolie. “Even in those days you couldn’t take your eyes off her,” he says of Jolie. “There was a charisma about her, a sort of live spirit. It was no surprise to me that she gained the success she did.” Obtaining financing within the Hollywood studio apparatus proved difficult, especially for a newcomer like Lurie, and he was forced to abandon projects about which he was particularly passionate. One of those unmade films, “The Tunnels of Cu Chi,” told the harrowing story of the sophisticated underground strongholds built by the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War and the U.S. “tunnel rats” who infiltrated them. Despite the star power of Kevin Costner behind the film, it never got made. “The movie looked at the Vietnam War not just through the eyes of American G.I.s, but also from the Vietnamese point of view,” Lurie says. “The story would have dealt with the human aspect of what it’s like to fight for your country, and also the complicated nature of being a tunnel rat. At the time it was too controversial for a studio to finance a movie that wasn’t told only from the Western perspective.” Jeffrey Lurie with Clark President David Angel at the Reunion Dinner. Even during his years on the West Coast, Lurie maintained his fanatical devotion to the Boston sports scene. In the pre-satellite dish days, he would drive hours to find any place that was airing the New England Patriots games — to a small Santa Barbara motel or across the border into Arizona. Once, on a trip to Santiago, Chile, he talked his way into police headquarters and into a stark room with a tiny television to catch the Pats in the playoffs. As it turned out, Lurie wasn’t just watching games. He was planning his next move. Jeff Lurie’s love of football dates back to the legendary 1958 championship game between the New York Giants and Baltimore Colts, which he watched on television with his father, Morris. Dad was a Giants fan; young Jeff favored the Colts because he liked their quarterback Johnny Unitas and he preferred their uniforms. The Colts won the overtime thriller in what has been branded “The Greatest Game Ever Played,” and Lurie was hooked. In the early 1990s he actively pursued his goal to own a sports franchise, putting together the financing for a bid to buy his hometown team, the Patriots. He lost out to Bob Kraft and then turned his attention to another club on the market, the Philadelphia Eagles, a team with a storied history, yet one that had experienced little playoff success for more than a decade. Lurie’s bid of $185 million won him the team, but at what cost? He was inheriting a franchise that appeared to be on a downward trajectory. The fans were alienated, the players clashed with management, the employees had grown disheartened, and the team’s relations with the Philadelphia community had frayed. The Eagles also competed in a city-owned stadium so dilapidated that it prevented the team from attracting top-notch players and coaches. The rat in Lurie’s office was only one in an army. Though Lurie knew the reality laid out before him, he also perceived the potential in this drowsing juggernaut. His experience in the movie business had offered him an insider’s view of how changing broadcast models could transform an industry. Cable television and satellite were changing the landscape. “In those days there was really a split between the entertainment industry and sports; people didn’t look at it as integrated, but we were just starting to see the explosion in the ways the sport could be distributed,” he says. “We would be making hit programming on a global scale. “It was scary because it was the first really big acquisition where I was risking a tremendous amount to take this opportunity. I couldn’t let my dream to own an NFL team confuse the analysis; the analysis had to come first. Eventually, it all came together.” Lurie went to work, hiring a management team and coalescing financial and community support for the construction of the state-of-the-art NovaCare Complex and the $500 million Lincoln Financial Stadium, an environmentally friendly facility outfitted with solar panels and wind turbines that produce much of the building’s electricity. Off the field, Lurie and his staff built a culture of community stewardship through the creation of the Eagles Youth Partnership. The nonprofit serves more than 50,000 low income children in the Greater Philadelphia area every year with a focus on health and education programming. EYP takes its services directly to the schools and neighborhoods with mobile programs — the Eagles Eye Mobile and Eagles Book Mobile — that have led the way for other organizations to emulate. In addition, each year, team members, from Lurie on down, build a playground in a disadvantaged neighborhood and remain connected with charitable organizations throughout the city and beyond. Lurie notes that the Eagles’ training facility features the Hall of Heroes, which is adorned with portraits, not of football players, but of Jonas Salk, Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and other scientists, humanitarians and activists whose accomplishments shook the world. In 2011, the Eagles were named the Team of the Year by Beyond Sport, an organization that promotes, develops and supports the use of sport to create positive social change worldwide. The award recognizes the top sports team in philanthropy across the globe. In addition to his charitable efforts within the organization, Lurie devotes his time to autism research on a global basis. “I’d always admired what the Red Sox did with the Jimmy Fund regarding cancer research, so when I bought the Eagles I made it a high priority that what we do in the community should be of equal priority to what we do on the football field,” he says. “That’s the way we’ve operated, inculcating in every player who we’ve brought in that they’re not just joining a football team, they’re also having an impact in the community.” On the field, Lurie and his football operations team built a winner, eventually hiring Andy Reid as coach and drafting Donovan McNabb at quarterback, a pairing that made the Eagles perpetual playoff contenders and led them to the 2005 Super Bowl (which they lost 24-21 to the Patriots). Today, he notes, despite struggling in the 2012 season, the team boasts a 60,000-person waiting list for season tickets, which is emblematic of Eagles fans’ near-mythic zealotry (memorably depicted in movies like “Invincible” and “Silver Linings Playbook”). In 2013 Forbes valued the franchise at $1.3 billion. Lurie resurrected the flagging Eagles so resoundingly that it inspired Harvard business professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter to chronicle the turnaround in her book “Confidence: How Winning and Losing Streaks Begin and End.” In assessing Lurie’s job as owner, Kanter wrote: “[Every] turnaround starts with the same overriding challenge: the need to make unpopular decisions about a situation whose full ugliness has been denied, and yet, at the same time, restore people’s confidence that they can start winning again.” Lurie has made those tough decisions. In 2010 he traded McNabb, and last year he parted ways with Reid — who has more wins than any coach in franchise history — and hired University of Oregon coach Chip Kelly as his on-field general. The moves were personally wrenching (Lurie remains close with both men and presided over McNabb’s induction into the Eagles’ Hall of Fame), yet emotion was put aside for the overall health of the team. In 2009 Lurie made the controversial decision to hire quarterback Michael Vick after he had served 21 months in federal prison for his involvement in a dog-fighting ring. Vick’s return to the football field was denounced by many; Lurie says bringing him back to the NFL “boiled down to the notion of second chances.” “If somebody has performed his jail time and satisfied the entire penalty, then society needs to give him a second chance,” he says. “Michael has been a wonderful teammate and a model citizen since we’ve given him that second chance.” Any story about a man who once earned a living making movies deserves a Hollywood ending, and Lurie’s is no different. Five years ago Lurie and his then-wife Christina (they’ve since divorced; Lurie is remarried) launched a documentary-film company, Screen Pass Pictures. He’d never been able to produce the kinds of feature movies he’d wanted during his years in Hollywood, and he saw the surging popularity of documentaries as a new opportunity to address important issues through film. “There was a time when it wasn’t worth it to make a documentary that might be seen by eleven people. Today, you can see documentaries in movie theaters, on HBO, Showtime, PBS. They’re finally getting distributed, and they’re having an impact.” The company’s 2010 film, “Inside Job,” detailing the global financial crisis, earned the Academy Award for best documentary film. Last year, the Screen Pass film “Inocente,” which chronicled the plight of a young undocumented immigrant artist, won the Oscar for best documentary short. “It’s humbling,” Lurie says. “I’m proud of it, but you don’t make a film because you think it’s going to win an Academy Award. You take on an issue, align yourself with talented filmmakers, and go from there.” The success of the NFL is like a blockbuster movie playing in real time. Contracts with the TV networks rake in billions (with good reason: the games dominate the ratings), Fantasy Football leagues are an obsession for millions of fans, and the Super Bowl has evolved into a de facto national holiday. And the Clarkie who refused to be rooted in old paradigms when new models were crying out to be invented, the guy who sat in a bleak basement office 19 years ago and was told by The Wall Street Journal that he’d made the biggest mistake of his life, could be forgiven if he simply sat back and said, “I told you so.” But that would require dwelling on the past when the future is so much more intriguing.

Why do viruses kill them? February 15, 2024 By Meredith Woodward King Many of us hear about cyanobacteria when summertime blooms of toxic blue-green algae lead to beach closings at freshwater ponds and lakes. But cyanobacteria are not all bad — those growing in the ocean produce more than 12 percent of the oxygen we breathe, according to Clark Biology Professor Nathan Ahlgren. “Cyanobacteria form an important foundation of life in the oceans,” says Ahlgren , a microbial ecologist. At the bottom of the oceans’ food chain, “they produce organic material and oxygen, just like plants on land do.” Study life on earth Are you interested in studying living things and how organisms interact? Major in biology The most abundant cyanobacteria in the ocean are Synechococcus and its sister genus, Prochlorococcus. Together, these single-celled microbes carry out about 25 percent of the photosynthesis in the ocean, and because half of the photosynthesis on earth occurs in the ocean, he explains, that means that “in every breath you take, some of that oxygen came from these tiny little things.” Because cyanobacteria are so key to supporting life on earth, it’s critical to understand how they interact with their environment and with other organisms, especially the viruses — called cyanophage — that infect them. “It’s important to figure out what viruses are killing these cyanobacteria, how they are killing them, and why,” Ahlgren says. “There are some estimates that viruses might kill half of the Synechococcus cells every day and then the Synechococcus regrows to replace them. So there is constant pressure put on the cyanobacteria to grow and survive.” In many places, the number of cyanobacteria in the ocean roughly remains the same from day to day, he notes. “But in reality, there’s this whole ecosystem that’s churning, this warfare of viruses and hosts happening back and forth, that is potentially changing the species or the details of who is there.” Since its launch in 2020, the NSF-funded research project has supported nine undergraduate students working in Professor Nathan Ahlgren’s lab to explore the dynamics between viruses and Synechococcus cyanobacteria. “I really enjoy getting the experience of working in a real lab. It’s been really great for me,” says Angell Jean-Laurent ’24, a biology major who hopes to apply to medical school or a Ph.D. program in biomedical science. Study funded by $1.1 million in NSF grants Funded by $1.1 million in grants over four years from the National Science Foundation, Ahlgren and his collaborator, Biology Professor Marcie Marston of Roger Williams University, are using a decade of water samples gathered from Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island to examine these interactions between the cyanophage and their host, Synechococcus cyanobacteria. “It’s important to figure out what viruses are killing these cyanobacteria, how they are killing them, and why,” Professor Nathan Ahlgren says. He and his colleagues continue to draw water samples from Narragansett Bay, adding to Roger Williams University biologist Marcie Marston’s 10-year collection. “There are probably hundreds of species of Synechococcus , and each one is slightly different,” Ahlgren says. “Of the viruses that infect Synechococcus , there are maybe thousands, maybe tens of thousands. So, we have this complex community of thousands of things that are all interacting with each other. With this grant, we are opening up the box, looking under the hood, and sorting out the details to understand what’s happening in that ecosystem.” Over three years, teams at Clark and Roger Williams have isolated more than 100 Synechococcus strains and 200 viruses from the samples. Ahlgren credits a former undergraduate student — Campbell (Cammie) MacKenzie ’21 — with isolating most of the Synechococcus . MacKenzie’s research resulted in a 2022 article, “ Genome Sequence of the Estuarine Synechococcus sp. Strain NB0720_010 ” in Microbial Genome Resources , on which she was first author; her co-authors were Marston; Javier Tabima Restrepo , assistant professor of biology; and Ahlgren. With the microbes isolated and their DNA purified, “we can use DNA sequencing technology to figure out which viruses are in that community,” Ahlgren says, “and to answer questions like, ‘Are they abundant? Are they just there for a short time? Are they there all the time?’ We’re looking for seasonal or temporal patterns.” The project in Narragansett Bay builds off work published by Emily Dart , Ph.D. ’23, who characterized cyanophage patterns over five years in waters off of California. “It’s a bit mind-boggling to think that something that you can’t really see can have major environmental or anthropogenic effects.” — Devon Rose Leaver ’24, M.S. ’25 In the lab, the researchers will cross-infect the viruses with the Synechococcus strains, pairing different combinations of isolates, to study the microbes’ interactions. “We’re looking at these patterns in detail,” he says. “Does everything infect everything else? Do viruses affect closely related Synechococcus? Or do some viruses infect a lot, and some don’t?” Their research eventually could be applied to other environments where viruses attack bacteria, from freshwater lakes and ponds to the human intestine, according to Ahlgren. “Our expectation,” he says, “is that some of the rules about how this churning, constantly changing community of bacteria and phage are working probably would be applicable to many other ecosystems.” Dukilda Hasanllari ’23 and other students have helped isolate more than 100 Synechococcus strains from water samples taken from Narragansett Bay. Students also have participated in the research project by sequencing genetic material from the Synechococcus cultures as part of The Genome Project, an upper-level undergraduate biology course that is being taught this semester by Professor Nathan Ahlgren and, in past semesters, by Professor Javier Tabima Restrepo. Providing research experience for students From Clark to grad school Conducting microbial ecology research with Clark Biology Professor Nathan Ahlgren and his collaborators helped Cameron McIlvenna ’23 land a spot in a Ph.D. program at the University of Delaware. At Clark, McIlvenna majored in biology, with a concentration in mathematical biology and bioinformatics, and minored in computer science. Working with Roger Williams University biologist Marcie Marston, McIlvenna dove deep into DNA sequencing data for Ahlgren and Marston’s research project, applying what he was learning about bioinformatics. Last spring, he accompanied Marston to the 11th Aquatic Virus Workshop at the University of Laval in Quebec and presented a poster based on that research. Through Marston, he also met researchers at the University of Delaware. Since its launch in 2020, the NSF-funded research project has supported nine undergraduate students working in Ahlgren’s lab — MacKenzie, Cameron McIlvenna ’23, Dukilda Hasanllari ’23, Dariy Vykhodtsev ’23, Angell Jean-Laurent ’24, Eric Litvack-Winkler ’24, Emily Rosenbaum ’24, Devon Rose Leaver ’24, M.S. ’25, and Kavi Francis ’26; a Ph.D. student, Reynaldo Ponce; and a postdoctoral researcher, Brent Robicheau, whose research on phytoplankton in the North Atlantic explored the effects of coastal climate change. As part of their research with Ahlgren, Robicheau and Leaver will examine whether climate change also is affecting interactions between viruses and Synechococcus. More undergraduate students have participated in the research by sequencing genetic material from the Synechococcus cultures as part of The Genome Project, an upper-level undergraduate biology course being taught this semester by Ahlgren and, in the past couple years, by Tabima. (MacKenzie’s research in the course led to her Microbial Genome Resources article.) Ahlgren also incorporates the research into his Viruses: Friends or Foes and microbiology courses. “I took Professor Ahlgren’s virology class, and I’ve been able to apply the information I’ve learned here in the lab with that we’ve studied in the class,” says Jean-Laurent, a biology major who hopes to apply to medical school or a Ph.D. program in biomedical science. “I really enjoy getting the experience of working in a real lab. It’s been really great for me.” Leaver became interested in marine biology and Ahlgren’s research when, in her first year at Clark, she took his microbiology class. A biology major and political science minor, she will start Clark’s Accelerated Degree Program in biology next fall. “I really like the work that I do here because it allows me to think about the multiple perspectives of research,” Leaver says. “Sometimes you’re simply observing that an organism behaves a certain way, and you’re spending a lot of time going in depth about what that data means.” But over time, she adds, researchers might “find bigger implications, like uncovering shifts in population dynamics and even how things might move around the ocean because of climate change. “It’s a bit mind-boggling,” she adds, “to think that something that you can’t really see can have major environmental or anthropogenic effects.” “I really like the work that I do here because it allows me to think about the multiple perspectives of research,” says Devon Rose Leaver ’24, M.S. ’25 (above, working with Professor Nathan Ahglren in his lab). In the Accelerated Degree Program in biology next year, Leaver plans to examine whether climate change is affecting interactions between viruses and Synechococcus.

Clark researcher proposes ‘breaking silos’ to make it happen January 11, 2024 By Meredith Woodward King More than 750 million people are on the move worldwide, including this Syrian refugee who migrated to Worcester. Many of these migrants have much to offer cities that are faced with sustainability challenges, researchers say. (Photo by Steven King, Clark University photographer) Most policymakers focus on migration and sustainability as separate issues, missing key opportunities to implement transformational change in their cities, according to an article co-authored by a Clark anthropologist and published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). “There is widespread discussion of both sustainability and migration as global political challenges of the 21 st century, but there is little understanding of how they are related and, consequently, how they can be addressed together in a cohesive action,” Anita Fábos , a professor in Clark’s Sustainability and Social Justice Department, and her peers write in “Bridging and Breaking Silos: Transformational Governance of the Migration-Sustainability Nexus.” “Migration is thought of as external to sustainability concerns and migrants are left out of national and urban sustainability planning.” From December 2020 to November 2021, the researchers interviewed 73 representatives involved in migration and sustainability efforts through governmental and non-governmental organizations in Worcester and three cities in Europe: Amsterdam, Brussels, and Malmö, Sweden. They discovered that the officials “find it challenging to see how they could be working together and that migrants are rarely conceived of as sustainability actors and/or targeted populations of sustainability policy.” “There is widespread discussion of both sustainability and migration as global political challenges of the 21 st century, but there is little understanding of how they are related and, consequently, how they can be addressed together in a cohesive action.” — Anita Fábos et al Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences This lack of collaboration stems, in large part, from a “silo approach” in “rigid, fixed governance institutions that rely on vertical organizational structures at the expense of horizontal coordination,” the authors note. They hope their research “may help stimulate new, more integrative and inclusive conversations among [those] who have an interest and an influence at the migration-sustainability nexus.” These conversations are taking on even more urgency, they add, “with the impacts of climate change expected to drive more migration to urban areas.” Worcester and Brussels won the authors’ attention for policy solutions that favor the integration of migrants into communities instead of encouraging complete assimilation, which often leads to newcomers’ dropping their language and cultural traditions. As an example, the researchers pointed to a Massachusetts state climate statute that recognizes “environmental justice communities,” allowing “local policymakers to designate specific communities — including those with high percentages of migrants — for state and national programs toward a green transformation.” Anita Fábos’ research on migration, transformation, and sustainability has been funded by a two-year National Science Foundation grant as part of the Belmont Forum. Twenty-one percent of Worcester’s 200,000 residents were born outside of the United States, with the largest migrant groups more recently coming from Ghana, the Dominican Republic, Brazil, and Albania, according to Fábos. A number of factors affecting migrants “have negative implications for social cohesion and, in turn, for healthy and sustainable societies,” she explained at a World Health Summit meeting of experts addressing migrant and refugee health. During the pandemic, these factors — health disparities, decreased mobility due to travel restrictions and cutbacks in public transportation, and lack of green space in the high-density neighborhoods where most migrants live — all contributed to their increased stress and mental health issues, she said. Opportunities for mobility allow migrants to “remain connected to their supportive social networks, access health services, and be included as members of local communities,” Fábos explained during the World Health Summit presentation. “Cities that include an understanding of the health aspects of mobility in their planning toward health and sustainability may be better off in addressing climate change adaptation.” Fábos’ research on migration, transformation, and sustainability has been funded by a two-year National Science Foundation grant as part of the Belmont Forum , a partnership of funding organizations, international science councils, and regional consortia committed to the advancement of transdisciplinary science. Her co-principal investigator on the grant has been Ed Carr , a professor in the Sustainability and Social Justice Department. The two worked with peers from universities across the world on Project Misty : Migration, Transformation, Sustainability, which, according to researchers, aims to “support the emergence of a more empathetic and evidence-based approach to migration management in cities.” In a 2019 article in The Lancet, Fábos and her peers argued that the migration of 750 million people worldwide “is a major driving force of planetary and population health” and that the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals “need to move beyond the implicit assumption that sedentary lives are the norm and that it is only safe, orderly, and regular migration that contributes to sustainable development. We suggest that, when migration is incorporated as an inherent and continuing part of social transformations, it will become central to long-term climate resilience and adaptation.” Worcester & World Related Stories More from this topic ‘We want to build this to strengthen people’ Clark student helps develop nationwide survey for transition-to-college study More from this topic Apply Undergrad Apply Grad Give Contact Us Helpful Links Helpful Links Report a Concern Campus Safety Events Offices Employment Website Feedback Follow Us See more of us on Facebook See more of us on Twitter See more of us on Instagram See more of us on TikTok See more of us on YouTube See more of us on LinkedIn See more of us on Threads Return to Clark University Homepage Challenge Convention.

At the time, the reservoir was at 38 percent capacity — the driest it had been at that time of year since water level records began in 1976. The summer of 2023 is headed for the record books, with increasing heat waves, wildfires, tropical storms, and flooding. July was declared the hottest month on earth since records began in 1880 . To better understand how the earth is changing, the impact of extreme climate events, and how humans might adapt, researchers use satellite images to extrapolate data. Earth and data scientists face a monumental challenge, however: By 2024, new satellite missions will produce 250,000 terabytes of data, NASA estimates. How much data is that? If you were snapping 100 photos a day with an iPhone, it would take you 1.7 million years to accumulate that many terabytes of data. How can researchers mine all this satellite data, along with the information contained in millions of published scientific papers? And how can they effectively share data with policymakers and the public? Hamed Alemohammad Hamed Alemohammad, director of Clark’s new Center for Geospatial Analytics , and six graduate students — working with NASA and IBM — are hoping artificial intelligence (AI) can answer these questions. Together, they have produced the world’s first geospatial AI foundation model, a milestone that will allow climate and earth scientists to access and study data more quickly and efficiently. “In construction, you put the foundation on the ground, and then you build a customized structure on top. The foundation model is practically the same thing. But in this case, you are building a deep learning model,” says Alemohammad, associate professor in Clark’s Graduate School of Geography. Using a foundation model to build generative AI models that can be customized for various applications, rather than building those custom models from scratch, saves researchers time and money, he explains. “That’s really the bottom line here. Using fewer samples of data, you can get similar or better accuracy with the foundation model compared to building a supervised model which requires large number of samples.” ChatGPT and Google’s Bard are examples of generative models built on top of the first large language foundation model. The Clark/NASA/IBM project “is the first foundation model in geospatial earth science,” Alemohammad says. “We want to assess the usability of foundation models in this field.” This year, IBM and NASA’s Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team ( IMPACT ) deployed the geospatial AI foundation model to comb through and extract information from a year of raw, unlabeled imagery data gathered by the space agency’s Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) satellite from across the continental United States. In July, the team released the foundation model on Hugging Face , a repository for open-source machine learning models. The foundation model — fine-tuned on human-labeled data for mapping of floods and burn scars from wildfires — so far has demonstrated a 15 percent improvement over other state-of-the-art techniques, according to IBM . The effort is tied to NASA’s goal to make data, code, and AI models available to everyone through its Open-Source Science Initiative . “We believe that foundation models have the potential to change the way observational data are analyzed and help us to better understand our planet,” says Kevin Murphy , chief science data officer at NASA. “And by open-sourcing such models and making them available to the world, we hope to multiply their impact.” Clark’s role in the geospatial AI project From top, the first three images of an area southwest of Wausau, Wisconsin, were taken over time by a NASA satellite. Researchers input the satellite images into the geospatial AI foundation model, which created the fourth image (bottom) indicating the types of crops and land cover, coded by color: dark green indicates soybeans; gold, corn; red, cotton; bright pink, alfalfa; brown, winter wheat; dark blue, open water; light blue, wetlands; light green, forest; and gray, developed or barren land. The Clark team is refining and evaluating the geospatial AI foundation model for so-called downstream applications. For instance, they are examining whether the fine-tuned foundation model can predict the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s data on the types of crops grown in the U.S. The crop classification layer — which helps identify crops in vast amounts of satellite data and has the potential to mitigate expensive ground data collections — was released with the foundation model in July. “Having a near-real-time map of what is growing, and where, can be very important for policymaking,” Alemohammad says. “If a severe event happens, like a heat wave or a flooding, you can immediately assess the damage in terms of impact on the harvest, for example.” Such maps also could show the impacts of specific government policies, he adds. “If the government, for example, imposes taxes on specific crops, or allows export of those crops, one can use these maps to characterize their implications on production.” The research team hopes that more investment at global scale to collect high-quality ground reference data can allow scientists to study global food-production trends using advancement in these foundation models. “The U.S. is a very resilient country in terms of production, but if you consider a smaller country, which is very dependent on certain crop types for internal consumption or for export, it is important to be able to monitor that, particularly during the growing season,” Alemohammad says. Sustainable agriculture practices also could be tracked across the world, he suggests, including crop rotation, application of fertilizer, maintaining the distance between trees, and tillage of fields. “Or do farmers rely on crop burning? That is a very damaging practice in many parts of the world, including India and Mexico.” Alemohammad, the principal investigator, and his graduate assistants — Mike Cecil, Sam Khallaghi, and Fatemeh Kordi, all doctoral students in geography ; Denys Godwin and Hanxi (Steve) Li, a master’s student in geographic information science ; and Maryam Ahmadi, a master’s student in business analytics — are continuing work on the project via a grant from NASA IMPACT, a team based at the Marshall Space Flight Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. The Clark team is exploring three types of downstream applications: Segmentation , through which similarly colored and shaped pixels in satellite images are grouped together, allowing crops to be labeled and classified. Multi-label image classification , which would allow an AI model to pinpoint and classify what types of crops are grown or if water exists within a large area of land — a state or region, for example. Cloud gap filling , where the AI model uses prior days’ images, even months apart, to “fill in” an area of land that could not otherwise be captured by a satellite because of cloud coverage. The Clark team and their NASA and IBM colleagues already are receiving feedback from researchers accessing the foundation model. “We want people to play with the model,” he says. “In a way, they’re helping us test it.” Study data science and geographic information science (GIS) Study earth system science/environmental science Science & Technology Environment & Sustainability Related Stories More from this topic How sound is changing the planet The art of addressing sea level rise More from this topic Apply Undergrad Apply Grad Give Contact Us Helpful Links Helpful Links Report a Concern Campus Safety Events Offices Employment Website Feedback Follow Us See more of us on Facebook See more of us on Twitter See more of us on Instagram See more of us on TikTok See more of us on YouTube See more of us on LinkedIn See more of us on Threads Return to Clark University Homepage Challenge Convention.

Singers included the Clark University Choir. (Photo: MidAmerica Productions/Mike Violago Photography) Last March, the Clark University Choir, led by Professor Cailin Marcel Manson, performed Verdi’s “Requiem” at Carnegie Hall. Their next performance takes place closer to home, and with even more singing. The choir, along with the Clark University Symphony Orchestra, will take to the stage at Mechanics Hall on Saturday, Nov. 18, for a staged concert of “Turandot,” the final opera by Giacomo Puccini. Tickets are free, but required . ‘Turandot’ at Mechanics Hall 320 Main St., Worcester Saturday, Nov. 18 7 p.m. (doors open at 6:30) Reserve tickets » “Turandot” is a fairy tale, set in long-ago China, centering around Princess Turandot. She doesn’t want to get married, so demands each suitor answer three impossible riddles — and if they fail, they die. Calaf, prince of the recently conquered state of Tartary, sees the princess and falls in love with her at first sight. He solves the riddles and then gambles on his life with one of his own. The Clark University Choir and Clark University Symphony Orchestra will be joined by the New England Repertory Orchestra and the Worcester Children’s Chorus . Special guest soloists include soprano Othalie Graham , who has sung “Turandot” in opera houses across the globe — and whom Manson says is one of the most sought-after singers for the role — and soprano Janinah Burnett , whose performance credits include eight seasons as a principal at the Metropolitan Opera. Other soloists include tenor Joshua Collier, artistic director of the Barn Opera in Brandon, Vermont, and Nicholas Tocci, baritone and professor at Clark. Clark students will fill smaller solo roles. Opera “brings out our most visceral, humanistic responses to people and situations,” says Zoe Marinakos ’24, president of the Clark University Choirs and a vocal performance major. “In real life, you have to be polite, put your emotions aside. But in opera, you can ignore that and just go for it.” As the choir gets ready to work with the soloists and the orchestra in rehearsals next week, Manson sat down to talk about the project and how it enhances the experience of Clark’s music students. Why “Turandot”? Well, it is grand opera! (Laughs.) The chorus in “Turandot” is onstage for over half of the opera, more than in any other of Puccini’s works. It’s the perfect work for this collaborative project — we’re performing the entire opera with no cuts and full orchestration, including special percussion and a harp, because this year, we have a first-year student who plays the harp. How do projects like this fit in with Clark’s tradition of being part of the community? There’s social impact in what we do. I think about who it reaches, who it serves, and how it changes lives. By bringing together these different groups to perform this work, we involve the larger community. Some members of the New England Repertory Orchestra are music educators, and their students know about their performances. The Worcester Children’s Chorus is singing with us; families and friends who come to see a member of the children’s chorus are going to connect with the gathered Clark community. One of our soloists is a music teacher in Auburn, and his students can come and know they have a connection with someone on the stage. The potential to participate in music-making at this high level becomes real. Since you came to Clark in 2019, you’ve made sure Clark students have performance opportunities beyond department concerts and recitals. Why is that so important — and where does “Turandot” fit in? It’s the way orchestral — and vocal — education should be done now. Students at large music schools have an advantage. They get constant exposure to major orchestras and professional opera, and some advanced students might get the chance to step in as substitutes or to augment the professional ranks. There are real networks being formed, and strong preparation for the profession. Even though we are a very small music program, the students in our ensembles — many of whom are not music majors — get exposed to the genuine article in a participative way. It’s one thing to tell students to go see an opera, to go see an orchestra and listen to how they do it. But when they get the opportunity to play alongside professionals, it’s a different level of understanding. What are the dynamics between a conductor and the ensemble when it’s not a professor-student relationship, but colleagues working together to make something happen? Because they get to be part of these things, the students — instrumental and vocal — become more aware of what they’re stepping into if they pursue music performance as a profession. They’ll see what the expectations are. And it enhances the experience for them in such palpable ways; they get to be part of a really refined sound and know what it feels like to contribute to that. “Turandot” is set in China, and the opera has been described as problematic. How have you addressed the issues within the libretto? Both ensembles, the chorus and the orchestra, have talked proactively about the subtext and the undertones of the opera. We’ve talked about how Puccini never actually went to China, so cultural appropriation and stereotypes are present. We remember that it’s a fairy tale — a fantasy. Once we removed the false placement of the drama, we realized there are so many more layers in the libretto, like societal oppression and issues surrounding gender roles. The chorus plays the part of the people over whom Turandot and her father, the emperor, rule. The populace is incredibly, harshly oppressed. In the space of three minutes, they go from cheering for a prince’s execution, to begging for his life, and then to swearing their loyalty to the princess. Later, they stand by and watch while an innocent young woman is tortured. That’s what internalized oppression and being in a constant struggle of survival does to a person — one student actually said, “It distorts you” — and the student musicians have been exploring these themes in conversations throughout our rehearsals that so they can believably embody these characters and/or tell the story through sound. These substantive conversations would never have happened, at this level of concentration, without “Turandot.” The title character of “Turandot” is a woman, but the leading man — the tenor — performs the opera’s most famous aria, “Nessun Dorma.” What does that say about the role of women in opera? Most of the operatic canon is male-heavy — this is why gender parity or non-traditional casting are important developments in the operatic field. In “Turandot,” there are only two principal female characters — but they are the ones who propel the drama. They are the ones around whom the story hinges. For me, Liu is the actual heroine of the entire piece. The staying power of “Nessun Dorma” — besides the high notes and the great — is that the odds are stacked against Calaf from the beginning. He’s the underdog; he’s a prince without a kingdom. But in this aria, he doesn’t say, “I hope I win” — he says, “ Vincerò .” I will win. That resonates with me, my own journey as an artist-teacher, and with the wonderful things we are accomplishing in Music at Clark. We are a small but mighty music program at a small but mighty school. It takes grit, determination, collaboration, and vision to do the type of projects we’ve been doing. We make the most of what we have; if we keep doing these things and stay the course — Vincerò. Vinceremo . We will win.

Ethiopian farmers may hold the answer, and researchers are listening to them January 25, 2024 By Meredith Woodward King Farmer Hasan Abagaz and researcher Seid Hassen examine a traditional mixture of wheat and barley in Kutabir District, South Wollo, Ethiopia. (Photo by Alex McAlvay, New York Botanical Garden) A Clark University professor is part of an international research project to determine whether Ethiopian farmers’ age-old practice of planting and harvesting traditional grain mixtures could offer a climate-resilient solution to global food insecurity. Research food security Clark University’s Department of Sustainability and Social Justice seeks two graduate students to join the team researching traditional grain mixtures in Ethiopia . Students may apply to any of these four programs: M.S. in Environmental Science & Policy M.A. in International Development M.S. in Geographic Information Science M.S. in Sustainable Food Systems Morgan Ruelle, a professor of environmental science and policy in Clark’s Department of Sustainability and Social Justice , is collaborating with researchers from Cornell University, City University of New York, the New York Botanical Garden, Ethiopia’s Addis Ababa University and Wollo University, and the Ethiopia Public Health Institute. The project is funded by the Rockefeller Foundation’s Periodic Table of Food Initiative . “We’re interested in how the diversity of the grains relates to climate adaptation. In some cases, the farmers are planting five to seven different varieties of two different species in a single field,” Ruelle says. “They’re planted together, harvested together, used together, saved together, and then planted again the next year.” From his office at Clark, Ruelle — who speaks Amharic, the national language of Ethiopia — is co-designing ethnobotanical and agroecological research with faculty and Ph.D. students in ethnobotany at Addis Ababa University. The students are interviewing hundreds of farmers, district administrators, and extension agents about their traditional practices. Armed with smartphones and notebooks, the students ask the farmers about their knowledge and use of four grain mixtures: wheat and barley; faba (fava) beans and field peas; sorghum; and teff, which is used to make injera, the pancake-like flatbread and a mainstay of Ethiopian meals. The students then upload that data to a server for analysis, with support from research partners in the United States and Ethiopia. A mixture of grains might include wheat and barley. (photo by Alex McAlvay) Meanwhile, master’s students in agronomy and agricultural science from Wollo University are conducting agricultural trials with 10 farmers, who are experimenting with different ratios of grain mixtures to see how they affect crop yields and nutritional values. This fall, two master’s students from Clark’s Department of Sustainability and Social Justice will join the project, traveling to Ethiopia in summer 2025 to work with Addis Ababa students and faculty, including Professor Zemede Asfaw, whom Ruelle calls “the father of ethnobotany in Ethiopia.” Ruelle first met Zemede in 2010 when, as a Ph.D. student at Cornell, he was conducting research on plant diversity in Ethiopia. Zemede later served on Ruelle’s dissertation committee. “He’s a very talented researcher,” Ruelle says. “He taught me how to interview farmers. So much of that involved his humility, patience, and kindness.” ‘An example of really sophisticated indigenous knowledge’ Ruelle’s newly acquired interviewing skills came in handy when, in 2011, he first began hearing from farmers about duragna , a mixture of wheat, barley, and other cereals broadcast as a mixture in the same field — not side by side in alternating rows, a more common practice called intercropping. Grains growing in a field in the Wollo region of Ethiopia (photo by Morgan Ruelle) Ruelle’s talks with farmers fueled more research with colleagues at Cornell; he joined them in publishing a 2022 article, “ Cereal Species Mixtures: An Ancient Practice with Potential for Climate Resilience,” in Agronomy for Sustainable Development. This work also laid the groundwork for the team’s current — and much larger — collaborative research project in Ethiopia. The traditional grain mixtures — which are known as maslins in France, where they were first cultivated during Medieval times — are “self-evolutionary crops where the varieties compensate for each other depending on the climate and weather conditions in the particular year,” Ruelle explains. “The proportions of each component in the mixture changes from year to year,” he says. “If it’s really dry one season, the varieties that do better under dry conditions take over, and if it’s really wet, others become dominant.” Over time, the farmers have discovered, the mixtures produce more stable yields from year to year. Besides changes in precipitation patterns, the maslins also respond well to challenges like pests, diseases, and low soil quality. “These grain mixtures are an example of really sophisticated indigenous knowledge about crops,” Ruelle points out, “and it’s not easy to create the mixtures. You have to find varieties that will come to maturity at the same time, you have to use them year after year, and you have to observe and experiment with them to get the system to work.” A longstanding tradition under threat Maslins have been cultivated throughout the world for thousands of years in foods and beverages like bread, beer, and liquor, as well as to feed livestock. “The sowing of maslins, or cereal species mixtures, was formerly widespread in Eurasia and Northern Africa and continues to be employed by smallholder farmers in the Caucasus, Greek Islands, and the Horn of Africa, where they may represent a risk management strategy for climate variability,” Ruelle and his co-authors note in their article. Because large-scale farming and monoculture crops have dominated agriculture throughout the world, the planting of maslins has become scarce, and they are little studied, according to Ruelle. He and his peers hope to bring light to these practices before they disappear altogether. “If the practice disappears,” he warns, “it will take a lot of time to ever bring it back.” Why maslins could ‘feed the world’ The research project is focused on Ethiopia’s Wollo region, where famine killed as many as 1 million people in the mid-1980s. That human tragedy is still part of the cultural memory of Ethiopians and the rest of the world. In the West, it inspired Irish singer Bob Geldolf to pull together British pop stars in 1984 to produce a chart-topping Christmas song with the unforgettable refrain, “Feed the World.” An American benefit song, “We are the World,” soon followed. Together, they raised tens of millions of dollars for famine relief. Four decades later, however, 150 million people in Ethiopia and other African countries face another food crisis , this time brought on mostly by climate change, according to the British Red Cross. Food scarcity will get even worse in the future, says a landmark 2022 report from the International Panel on Climate Change, which notes that Africa remains the continent most vulnerable to drought-induced famine. Morgan Ruelle But Ruelle and his colleagues hope that their project could lead to positive impacts not only in Ethiopia but other regions across the world. Through its global project, the Periodic Table of Food Initiative, the Rockefeller Foundation is interested in the nutritional benefits of Ethiopia’s traditional grain mixtures, which, until now, have been ignored. “When you’re eating multiple varieties of wheat or barley, you’re getting all kinds of different nutrients in your grain,” Ruelle explains. “Grains are not similar in their nutrient content. Some are higher in iron, some are higher in calcium, and some are higher in folic acid.” Ethiopians know this, he adds. “A farmer will say, ‘I give this special mixture to my wife after she gives birth.’ They may not be identifying the chemicals or the nutrients per se, but they’re using certain foods for certain times of life or for certain ailments.” This indigenous knowledge could help others outside of Ethiopia, according to Ruelle. “As climate change affects crops and food sources across the world, traditional grain mixtures like these could nourish entire populations, including ourselves,” he says. “I’ve spoken to U.S.-based farmers — especially livestock producers — who are really interested in mixtures as a way to have more reliable yields, but they don’t have the varieties or the systems that the Ethiopians have held onto. So, it’s a really important contribution.” Europeans also are interested in bringing back traditional agricultural practices that long ago produced hearty breads and what some might call “the original craft beer.” “When tradition and innovation for climate change meet, there is double value,” Ruelle says. “People feel attached to these grain mixtures because they are what their ancestors practiced, but they also are wise for the future.” Worcester & World Environment & Sustainability Related Stories More from this topic How sound is changing the planet The art of addressing sea level rise More from this topic Apply Undergrad Apply Grad Give Contact Us Helpful Links Helpful Links Report a Concern Campus Safety Events Offices Employment Website Feedback Follow Us See more of us on Facebook See more of us on Twitter See more of us on Instagram See more of us on TikTok See more of us on YouTube See more of us on LinkedIn See more of us on Threads Return to Clark University Homepage Challenge Convention.

Change. Podcast Grief and rage as commentary Exploring solidarity from ancient Greece to modern social movements November 9, 2023 By Melissa Hanson Professor Danielle Hanley Grief and rage are at the center of political science Professor Danielle Hanley’s research. She’s working on her first book project, an examination of those two emotions in the context of Greek tragedy and contemporary protest movements. In “Medea,” a play written by Euripides in 5th-century BC Greece, the titular character seeks vengeance on her husband Jason as he leaves her for a Greek princess. A chorus of women initially rally in support of Medea. Hanley describes this as a form of “affective solidarity,” which grows out of the circulation of emotions that magnetically pull other people in — specifically emotions calling out an injustice. This also happens in 21st-century social justice movements, she notes. “The circulation of grief and rage is a kind of commentary on the state of affairs in the world. It’s what we express when we don’t have the right words,” says Hanley. “One of the things I’m thinking about is how to balance the different obligations we have to one another with our own liberation.” Challenge.

Podcast Letting go of gender pressure Masculinity as performance, not personality February 7, 2024 By Melissa Hanson Michael Addis Many people consider masculinity an inner essence or set of specific personality traits that define manhood. Psychology Professor Michael Addis has a different understanding. His research indicates masculinity is a performance a person gives to reinforce their gender in alignment with societal and cultural norms. “There’s no doubt that many of the things that that boys and men have been taught to do to perform their masculinity can be harmful to themselves and to people of other genders as well,” says Addis. Men who avoid being vulnerable in their relationships to appear masculine can live for decades with no emotional support, says Addis. Increased isolation could contribute to rising suicide rates among U.S. men ages 40 to 55, he notes. “There’s a whole range of positive experiences related to emotional awareness, intimacy, and connections with other people,” says Addis. “All of these things are helped by letting go of the pressure to be a certain way because of your gender.” Challenge.

Early Decision I and II are binding agreements —if admitted, you must enroll and withdraw other applications. Early Action Early Action is non-binding and allows first-year students to apply in the fall and receive their decision and financial aid award in January. Since you can apply Early Action to multiple colleges and universities, you’ll have more time and flexibility to explore all your options. Regular Decision Regular Decision is a non-binding decision round with an application deadline of January 15, and typical notification of our decisions in mid-to-late March. Transfer Applicants Clark welcomes transfer students from two- and four-year colleges. Each year, Clark welcomes about 75 new transfer students combined in the fall and spring semesters. Admissions deadlines are rolling each semester (see table). Submit transcripts, a faculty recommendation, and proof of good standing. Credit is granted for courses with a grade of C or higher. At least two years must be completed at Clark. International Applicants About 5% of Clark’s students come from outside the U.S. each year. If English is not your native language, you will need to submit an official TOEFL , Duolingo , or IELTS score report. We will consider your English proficiency holistically, based on your scores, transcript, essay, and letters of recommendation. We also strongly encourage all applicants to sit for an interview. This is especially important for applicants who do not speak English as a native language. Admissions for Spring Each year, Clark admits over 50 first-year and transfer students for spring admission. This term is becoming popular among first-year students who prefer to take a semester off or do a gap semester before starting college.

Assistant professor of biology Chandra Jack and her students are studying microbe interactions in plants to help farmers grow more food. Her research is funded by a $453,000 grant from the National Science Foundation and a $420,000 grant from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture’s Agriculture and Food Research Initiative, part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Students in the Introduction to Digital Filmmaking course work collectively on an original film project while studying theory and practice. The workshop gives students the chance to direct, design, produce, act, and edit. The HERO (Human-Environmental Regional Observatory) Program, led by geography professors Deborah Martin and John Rogan, engages student fellows in research to understand urban reforestation and its impact on communities. Their findings, which have shaped tree selection and community engagement strategies, support efforts to increase urban canopy cover and reduce energy usage in residential areas, contributing to greener, healthier cities across Massachusetts. Partnering with Massachusetts’ Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) and other agencies, HERO fellows study tree survivorship, growth, and community satisfaction with newly planted trees. Living laboratory: The Hadwen Arboretum, a 26-acre green space willed to Clark in 1907, serves as a focus for many of Clark’s environmental revitalization and research efforts. Investigations in Julio D’Arcy’s lab, in the Carson School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, are driven by pressing questions about energy, sustainability, and the future. Their research focuses on developing conducting polymers with versatile nanostructures, which have the potential to improve energy storage and conversion technologies and contribute to environmental solutions like water purification. Luna Pagan ’27 conducts dung beetle research in the lab. Evolutionary biologist Erin McCullough and her students study the mating rituals of dung beetles to understand how climate change might affect biodiversity Mark Jacobs ’89, MFA ’25, returned to Clark because he believes that virtual reality will be integral to the future of education. Jacobs is among the students working on a multi-discipline project in Central Mexico that will help policymakers and the public collectively understand how much is at stake under climate change.

Early Decision I and II are binding agreements —if admitted, you must enroll and withdraw other applications. Early Action Early Action is non-binding and allows first-year students to apply in the fall and receive their decision and financial aid award in January. Since you can apply Early Action to multiple colleges and universities, you’ll have more time and flexibility to explore all your options. Regular Decision Regular Decision is a non-binding decision round with an application deadline of January 15, and typical notification of our decisions in mid-to-late March. Transfer Applicants Clark welcomes transfer students from two- and four-year colleges. Each year, Clark welcomes about 75 new transfer students combined in the fall and spring semesters. Admissions deadlines are rolling each semester (see table). Submit transcripts, a faculty recommendation, and proof of good standing. Credit is granted for courses with a grade of C or higher. At least two years must be completed at Clark. International Applicants About 5% of Clark’s students come from outside the U.S. each year. If English is not your native language, you will need to submit an official TOEFL , Duolingo , or IELTS score report. We will consider your English proficiency holistically, based on your scores, transcript, essay, and letters of recommendation. We also strongly encourage all applicants to sit for an interview. This is especially important for applicants who do not speak English as a native language. Admissions for Spring Each year, Clark admits over 50 first-year and transfer students for spring admission. This term is becoming popular among first-year students who prefer to take a semester off or do a gap semester before starting college.
