Connect with Clark Request Information Find Your Admissions Counselor Interviews Information for School Counselors Application Process Undergraduate Admission Application Process You’ve spend a lot of time on your application, we can’t want to read it and learn more about you. What we consider We are looking for individuals who are eager to be engaged, community-focused, and who recognize that by improving themselves, they can also enhance the lives, environment, systems, and tools around them. At Clark University, there is no single path to success—every Clarkie forges their own unique journey. We encourage you to schedule an interview to help us understand you beyond your written application and to address any questions you may have about Clark. Feel free to reach out to your assigned counselor with any questions you might have throughout the process. The Clarkie profile Average High School GPA: 3.68 Mid 50% SAT: 1300-1440 Mid 50% ACT: 29-33 First-year student profile Reviewing Applications We read your transcript top to bottom, to get the full story of your academic journey. We value how you’ve challenged yourself and shown growth over time, particularly in your junior and senior years. Test scores are optional, as we believe standardized tests don’t fully represent most students. We’re proud to be test-optional. How you apply is your choice First-year applicants can apply to Clark using either the Common Application or the Coalition Application with Scoir. Choose the method that suits you best, but please submit only one application. There is no fee for either option. We look at your academic achievement We read your transcript top to bottom, to get the full story of your academic journey. We value how you’ve challenged yourself and shown growth over time, particularly in your junior and senior years. Test scores are optional, as we believe standardized tests don’t fully represent most students. We’re proud to be test-optional. Entrance Requirements A high school diploma or G.E.D. is required. We recommend: 4 years of English 3 years each of math, science, and social science 2 years of a foreign language (or American Sign Language) Additional elective courses We consider your involvement Your involvement in family, community, and high school activities beyond your classes is also important. Whether through athletics, family commitments, part-time jobs, or musicals, all experiences matter. Clark fosters an active and inclusive community; we value all ways of being engaged in your community and seek students who will learn from and with each other. We value the nice things others say about you Letters of recommendation help us understand who you are both in and out of the classroom. Your high school counselor provides one valuable prospective and teachers provide another. We suggest asking an academic teacher who knows you well to write a recommendation for you, someone who can speak to your strengths and growth as a student.

Schedule an interview Find your counselor Sign up for a campus visit According to our faculty Who thrives at Clark? “A curious student. A student who is willing to question their own beliefs, as well as everyone else’s.” “Interested in learning and growing, understands that learning and growing are as much their responsibility as ours.” “Not just someone who will study their books but someone who wants to engage in the community at large.” The waitlist What to do if you’re offered a spot on the waitlist If you are offered a spot on the waitlist, it’s important that you respond “yes” to remaining on the list. As space opens (including any financial aid we might be able to award), we look at the students who have actively said they are still interested in Clark by responding to our offer. We are typically able to offer a handful of students on the waitlist a spot in the first-year class every fall. If you are on the waitlist and very interested in Clark, please send your admissions counselor an email so they can make sure you are on the active “still interested” list. Frequently asked questions Is Clark test-optional? Yes. Clark University does not require students to submit either their SAT or ACT score as part of their application. Does your office have to receive my entire application by the deadline? Will you still review my application if some components are late? We strongly encourage you to submit all required materials by the deadline; however, we recognize it may not be possible in some cases. It’s most important that we receive your main application (either the Common App or the Coalition App with Scoir) by the deadline. Your other credentials may arrive after the deadline. You will be able to track your application materials in your applicant portal, and we’ll remind you by email of missing materials. If your application remains incomplete, it will be withdrawn, but only after we have attempted to notify you of what’s missing. It’s your responsibility to ensure your application is complete. Which application should I use, the Common Application or the Coalition Application with Scoir? You can apply using either application, and we do not have a preference which way you apply. Please submit only one application to Clark — you do not need to complete both! Neither application has a fee. How will I know when my application is complete? Once you’ve started your application, we’ll send you an email with information about how to log in to our applicant portal, and where you can check on the status of your materials, see what’s missing, and receive updates about your application. At peak periods around the deadlines, status updates on the portal are not immediate, so please allow for processing time. If you have questions about the status of your application, check your applicant portal, call 1-800-462-5275 or email our office. How will I be notified of Clark’s decision? All decisions are released through our applicant portal to your personal account, so you will be able to log in from anywhere to see your decision. You’ll receive credentials to sign in to this portal via email when we first receive your application materials. Note: We do not release admission decisions over the phone. Can I apply as a first-year student for spring admission? Yes, whether you are a U.S. citizens or an international student, you may apply as a first-year student for the spring semester. Follow the instructions for applying to Clark and submit your application by Nov. 1. Can I defer my enrollment if I am admitted via Regular Decision? Admitted students may postpone their enrollment for up to a year and must submit a request to defer in writing by May 1. A nonrefundable deposit (credited toward first-semester charges) is required. You cannot defer your enrollment at Clark if you intend to enroll in a degree-seeking program in the interim. Instead, you must reactivate your application and submit official transcripts for review. Can I receive Advanced Placement (AP) credit? Advanced Placement (AP) credit is defined as one unit of degree credit assigned for a score of 4 or 5 on a College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) AP exam taken after completion of an AP course and before the student formally matriculates. First-year students may receive credit for college work with grades of C or better completed prior to becoming a student at Clark University if that credit is in a content area deemed academically acceptable to Clark and is from an accredited college or university. First-year students may be awarded a maximum of eight units of credit (two semesters) for AP credit and/or credit from college courses taken while in high school.

Early Decision I and II are binding agreements —if admitted, you must enroll and withdraw other applications. Early Action Early Action is non-binding and allows first-year students to apply in the fall and receive their decision and financial aid award in January. Since you can apply Early Action to multiple colleges and universities, you’ll have more time and flexibility to explore all your options. Regular Decision Regular Decision is a non-binding decision round with an application deadline of January 15, and typical notification of our decisions in mid-to-late March. Transfer Applicants Clark welcomes transfer students from two- and four-year colleges. Each year, Clark welcomes about 75 new transfer students combined in the fall and spring semesters. Admissions deadlines are rolling each semester (see table). Submit transcripts, a faculty recommendation, and proof of good standing. Credit is granted for courses with a grade of C or higher. At least two years must be completed at Clark. International Applicants About 5% of Clark’s students come from outside the U.S. each year. If English is not your native language, you will need to submit an official TOEFL, Duolingo, or IELTS score report. We will consider your English proficiency holistically, based on your scores, transcript, essay, and letters of recommendation. We also strongly encourage all applicants to sit for an interview. This is especially important for applicants who do not speak English as a native language. Admissions for Spring Each year, Clark admits over 50 first-year and transfer students for spring admission. This term is becoming popular among first-year students who prefer to take a semester off or do a gap semester before starting college.

Our First-Year Experience (FYE) program gives you the opportunity to meet new friends, explore your interests, connect with mentors and advisors, and learn about the resources you need for success at Clark. FYE includes advising, Orientation, Clark Navigator, the First-Year Intensive course, and living in first-year residence halls. First-Year Success Advising From summer course registration to the end of your first year, your first-year success adviser will be there for you. Meet the Advisers Orientation Our Orientation programs are designed to help you begin the collegiate journey. Attend Orientation Clark Navigator Clark Navigator introduces you to Clark and Worcester through weekly activities. Get to Know Campus First-Year Intensive Course As a first-year student, you will register for a First-Year Intensive (FYI) course. Your FYI professor will become your pre-major adviser, counseling you on your academic choices at Clark and working with you for several semesters — until you declare a major (usually by the end of your sophomore year). Explore FYI First-Year Residence Halls A key part of the First-Year Experience is living in a residence hall with your peers. Here, you will get to know other first-year students and become accustomed to life at Clark. Each floor has at least one resident adviser who works to build community, support health and safety, and assists students in the building.

Submit Search Query First-Year Success Advising Home First-Year Success Advising Your first-year success advisor is like a personal life coach, helping you navigate Clark and answering any questions you have. They are there to support you from the summer before you start at Clark through May, at the end of your first year. Students will be required to meet with their FYSA twice — once at the beginning of the summer to check in and go through the checklist, and once as noted about advising for classes. Before your first year begins, you will meet with your first-year success advisor to discuss your academic interests and sign up for classes. To get the most out of this meeting, we suggest you: Read about Clark’s undergraduate curriculum. Review the course offerings and think about which courses interest you. Check out the Academic Advising Handbook available through the Academic Advising Center. Make a list of questions for your advising appointment. First-year courses fill up quickly! Make sure you meet with your advisor sooner rather than later. Watch for emails from Clark in June to find out when you should schedule a meeting. To set up the meeting: Complete the required online Advising and Registration Tutorial, which will introduce you to Clark’s course requirements. At the end of the tutorial, you will schedule an advising appointment with your advisor. Complete the Advisor Information Form so that your advisor gets a sense of your interests. You will meet with your advisor via Zoom. During the meeting, your advisor will give you a personal identification number (PIN) to register for classes. Once the academic year begins, feel free to check in with your first-year success advisor (also called your FYSA) for any questions you have about signing up for classes, connecting with faculty, getting involved in campus life, living on or off campus, and more.

Overdue Notification Schedule, Fines, and Fees Overdue Notification Schedule Library users are notified via email when materials are checked out from the library, when they are due, and are reminded of the due date in advance. If items are not returned or renewed in a timely fashion, automated reminders and alerts are emailed to the borrower for a period of time in an effort to avoid charging for lost items and processing fees. For most materials notifications are sent on the following schedule: On the day that the item(s) are borrowed, a receipt is emailed listing each item borrowed from the library, as well as its due date A notification is sent two days before item(s) are due A notice is sent on the day that item(s) are due indicating what items need to be returned A reminder/overdue notice is sent three (3) days after item(s) become overdue Another overdue notice is sent 15 days after the item(s) become overdue A final notice is sent 28 days after the item(s) become due, pending fines/fees are added to the borrower’s account, and a notification is emailed alerting the borrower to the accrual of pending fines/fees. One day later, a final email is sent, submitting a formal bill for all outstanding charges for item(s) that are not returned to the library. Exceptions to the Typical Notification Timeline Fewer notifications will be sent over a shorter period of time for the items borrowed from the following locations due to their shorter loan periods: Study Space Keys Library of Things items Course Reserve materials Fines and fees will accrue after an initial grace period of 2 minutes. Overdue items are billed to borrowers after 24 hours with a maximum late fee of up to $25.00 ($1.00 per minute in late fees accrued after the end of the grace period). Library staff understand mistakes happen and will waive accrued fees for first offenses. Billing Structure If billed, borrowers are responsible for a non-refundable $5.00 processing fee per item. If items are lost or deemed long-overdue, borrowers are responsible for a $50.00 replacement fee, waivable upon the return of the item. Exceptions to the typical billing structure If the Library’s telescope is deemed long overdue, lost, or damaged, the borrower will be responsible for a replacement fee of $500.00. The late return of the following materials may result in the accrual of additional processing fines of $1.00 per minute, up to $25.00 due to the high use/demand for these items: Study Space Keys Library of Things items Course Reserve materials Loss of Borrowing Privileges If materials are not returned or renewed in a timely fashion, borrowing privileges (including Interlibrary Loan privileges) may be revoked until items have been returned, charges have been paid, and the borrower’s account is returned to good standing. Extreme Cases Student Borrowers In extreme cases where a student borrower fails to work with library staff to bring their account back into good standing through the payment of outstanding fines, and/or the return of overdue items, the library may work with the Office of the University Registrar to place a hold on the borrower’s student account, preventing them from registering for classes, requesting transcripts, etc. until their library account is back in good standing. ARC Consortium Borrowers For ARC affiliated borrowers, extreme overdues will be billed to their home institution and borrowing privileges suspended until their account is returned to good standing.

Gems from the Archives Clark’s Archives and Special Collections houses approximately 7,000 linear feet of materials. Ranging from books and artifacts to manuscripts and dissertations, the collections capture the essence of Clark and its storied history. The Archives includes photos of the Clark Cougars men’s basketball team from 1925 to 2003. Postcard depicting Jonas Clark Hall and the Science Building. Students jot down notes while listening to a lecture in the late 1950s or early ’60s. An old corner store, now the site of the famous and beloved Annie’s Clark Brunch.

In 1914, Robert Goddard was awarded his first two patents for the rocket apparatus: for a liquid-fuel gun rocket and a multistage step rocket. Frequently Asked Questions Where are the Archives? Archives and Special Collections and the Rare Book Room are located on the first floor of the Goddard Library, off the Academic Commons. Can I check out materials and use them outside of the Archives? No, you will need to use the materials in the Archives or Rare Book Room. Our materials do not circulate but we are able to digitize some materials and make them available through our website. Can I use my phone camera to scan pages of the book I will be using? Yes. as long as you do not use a flash. Can I see the records of someone who had attended Clark in past years, like a grandfather? We are not allowed to show the records of someone who is still alive to another person. If the person you are interested in has died, we would need to see some record of that, like an obituary, before showing the materials. Do you have all the dissertations and theses that were written at Clark? We have most of them. Before the Archives were established in 1972, all theses and dissertations were in the circulating collection of the University library, and some were borrowed and never returned. Because the University has only this one copy, we do not lend out master’s or doctoral theses, and they must be used on site. We also digitize theses and dissertations, when feasible. Libbey Slide Collection In 1928, Clark University was given the library of Dr. William Libbey, professor of physical geography and director of the Museum of Geology and Archeology at Princeton University. Included in the gift were 14,000 lantern slides dating between 1860 and 1910. The collection consists of both commercial sets as well as personal original photographs. It includes 100 series of slides — each dealing with a specific topic, state, or country — representing a remarkable cross section of the geography and people of many parts of the globe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. About Lantern Slides Lantern slides, the precursor to modern cardboard- or plastic-mounted slides, consist of two small glass plates. One plate is coated with an emulsion that captures an image when exposed to light, and a second glass plate is placed over the first to protect the emulsion. A cutout border, usually of black paper, is placed between the glass plates to act as a frame for the picture. The glass plates are sealed together with black tape. The projector used to illuminate the slides was called a “magic lantern” — hence the term “lantern slides.” Although magic lanterns were used to project transparent drawings before 1839, it was not until 1850 that glass photographic slides were made in the United States. They became a common form of home entertainment, reaching their highest level of popularity by 1900. They continued to be widely used until 35mm film and cameras became readily available in the late 1920s to the mid-1930s. Generally, lantern slides were black and white, but they could be hand-tinted with transparent oils. They were often commercially produced and typically sold by opticians who purchased the rights to the photographs, reproduced them as lantern slides, and sold them either singly or in sets. Descriptive booklets were often included with the sets. Many of the pioneers of photography had their photographs reproduced in this fashion. The Libbey Slide Collection Libbey became interested in photography as an undergraduate at Princeton University and embarked on many expeditions during his lifetime. Many of those travels are documented in his collection. The series housed at Clark includes photographs from: An 1877 Princeton scientific expedition to Utah. An 1878 expedition to view a solar eclipse near Denver, Colorado. An 1886 expedition organized by the New York Times to climb Mt. St. Elias in Alaska alongside Lt. Frederick Schwatka. This series includes photographs of the Yakutat Indians in Yakutat Bay. 1894 and 1899 Peary Expeditions to Greenland. A 1902 expedition to Jordan, about which Libbey co-authored his most famous publication, The Jordan Valley and Petra. A 1908 expedition to Yellowstone Park. There are currently approximately 20,000 glass lantern slides housed in Clark University’s Map Library. In addition to the 14,000 from Libbey’s personal collection, 6,000 more were acquired from Clark’s Graduate School of Geography in 1985. Libbey Slides Women at Karta Bar. Alaska. Women in Upernavik.

Submit Search Query Academic Affairs Updates Course Evaluations ClarkEfolio Contact Us Academic Affairs Updates Course Evaluations ClarkEfolio Contact Us Course Evaluations Home Course Evaluations Electronic University-Wide Course Evaluations will be available for students for the Spring 2025 term according to the following schedule: UG/GS First Half courses: Evaluations open for students on February 7, 2025 and will remain open through February 28, 2025. ALCI full-term courses: Evaluations open for students on April 7, 2025 and will remain open through April 21, 2025. UG/GS Second Half courses: Evaluations open for students on April 15, 2025 and will remain open through May 6, 2025. ALL OTHER COURSES (FYI and UG/GS Full Term courses): Evaluations open for students on April 15, 2025 and will remain open through April 29, 2025. About the eUWCE and FAQ What is the eUWCE? The electronic University-Wide Course Evaluation (eUWCE) is a questionnaire to solicit feedback from undergraduate and graduate students on courses and teaching. Feedback from students is critical to help inform improvements in the quality of instruction at Clark. Instructors benefit by learning strengths and weakness of their teaching methods. Course evaluations are one of multiple methods used to evaluate an instructor’s teaching performance. In Fall 2017, the Office of the Provost and the Office of Strategic Analytics and Institutional Research (STAIR) launched online course evaluations through explorance (explorance.com/course-evaluations), a fully-hosted online course evaluation and survey software system. What’s the process for administering course evaluations? Evaluations are administered in the last several weeks of each course. The specific dates will be announced in advance. Many instructors will elect to administer their course evaluations during a class session. In these cases, the evaluations will become available to students on the date arranged by the instructor, and will remain available until the end of the evaluation period, which is generally the last day of classes. For instructors who do not wish to administer evaluations during class, the evaluation will be available to students online at any point between the evaluation start- and end-date (emails will be sent announcing these dates, which may vary by class). Instructors who administer in-class evaluations should announce the date to students in a class session before the scheduled in-class evaluation, and share the following information: In a class session before in-class evaluations: Instructors should ask students to bring an internet-enabled device to class on the day that evaluations will be administered. Students can use a laptop, smartphone, tablet, etc. Instructors should talk with their students briefly about the importance of course evaluations and how those evaluations are used. Instructors should tell their students that feedback is valued and that instructors use student feedback to make improvements to courses. Instructors should let students know that they are interested in both positive and critical feedback on the course. What aspects of the course and/or instruction helped students learn? What aspects might be changed to help future students learn more effectively? Instructors should remind students that evaluations are completely confidential. Instructors will not be able to see any evaluations until after final grades have been submitted. Instructors will only see course evaluation results in the aggregate; they will not able to connect any particular comment to any particular student. Instructors should let students know that course instructors are the primary audience for their feedback, but that others will potentially read their evaluations, including department and school administrators. Course evaluations play an important role in personnel evaluations and in curriculum planning. On the day of in-class evaluations: Step 1. Instructors should direct students to Canvas where they will see a list of evaluations they may complete on-line. In addition, students will receive an email invitation with instructions and a list of courses in which they are enrolled. Instructors should remind students that emails have been sent to students’ official Clark email address. Step 2: Please reiterate to students that evaluations are completely confidential. Instructors will not be able to see any evaluations until after final grades have been submitted. Instructors will only see course evaluation results in the aggregate; they will not able to connect any particular comment to any particular student. Step 3: Instructors should step out of the classroom while the students complete the evaluation. What if an instructor opts not to administer the course evaluations in a class session?What is the eUWCE? Students will receive an initial email when their course evaluations become available along with two follow-up reminders. Students will be able to complete their course evaluations using their own internet-enabled device or a computer in a Clark computer lab. Not all courses begin and end on the same schedule so these dates can vary. When is an individual student’s evaluation considered complete? As soon as a student completes an evaluation and clicks the “submit” button, it’s done and can’t be altered. A student will only be able to submit one evaluation per course. Is there a deadline after which students cannot complete the evaluation? Yes. The eUWCE system generally closes @ 11:59pm on the posted end date (see schedule above). No one can complete a course evaluation after the evaluation closes; these dates will be announced through email instructions. Faculty should announce to students this deadline, and encourage students to complete their course evaluations by this time. Can a student complete a course evaluation if they miss the class session where the instructor administers it? Yes. Once opened by an instructor, the eUWCE remains available to students outside of class until they click the “submit” button or the evaluation period for the course closes. If students do not complete their course evaluation in class, they may use any internet-enabled device, including computers in Clark computer labs, for this purpose. Are the results of the eUWTE confidential? Student evaluations are confidential and anonymous to the instructor of the course, department chairs and deans. In other words, these faculty and administrators will not be able to connect a course evaluation to a particular student submitting an evaluation. Instructors have access only to courses they taught. Department chairs have access to results from all course evaluations within their department. Deans have access to all course evaluation results within the college. What do students need to bring to class to complete a course evaluation? Students should bring an internet-enabled device to class on the day you plan to administer the evaluations. They can use a laptop, smartphone, tablet, etc. Will students be able to see any of the evaluation results? No. Currently evaluation results are only available to the instructor and select administrators. Why do instructors talk to students about the importance of course evaluations? Talking to students about how results are typically used and how to provide constructive feedback can help improve the usefulness of the results. Improve response rates and improve the value of results: Students commonly suspect that course evaluation results do not get used; this is one reason for low response rates. Demonstrating that student feedback matters can boost response rates and provide a more accurate representation of students’ experiences. Improve student engagement and learning: A conversation about evaluations can help establish rapport with students. Discussing what sorts of responses are helpful for an instructor, and why, can help students understand an instructor’s teaching methods and the course learning goals. Students tend to respond better and “step up to the plate” when they understand how teaching methods connect with learning goals.[From Office of Assessment of Teaching and Learning, Washington State University, Elizabeth Carney, Ph.D.] Where can students and instructors seek help? For questions and concerns related to course evaluations, please email eUWCE system administrators. Can instructors monitor response rates for their courses? Yes. Instructors can monitor the evaluation response rates for their courses up until the last official day of the course (which is often different than the last day of class). However instructors will only see completion rates and not information about which students in their course have completed an evaluation or any of the submitted student responses. Instructions on how to access the response rates. When will aggregate course evaluation feedback be made available to individual instructors and select administrators?eUWCE? Course evaluation reports are generally made available approximately four weeks after the semester ends. Instructors and select administrators will receive an automated message from the eUWCE system when the reports are available for viewing. A link to view reports is available on the left- hand side of ClarkYOU. To protect student confidentiality, courses with fewer than 5 responses will not be distributed to instructors but only department chairs and deans. More documentation about how to access reports and Explorance Blue are available at our OneDrive folder. How are teaching assistants (TAs) evaluated? Teaching assistants are not currently evaluated using the UWCE. Departments will administer paper evaluations of TAs separately. Which courses are excluded from the eUWCE course evaluation process by default? By default, courses with fewer than 5 students as well as directed studies, laboratory and discussion sections and honors courses are excluded from evaluations. Prior to the administration of the course evaluation period, departments will review these courses, and may opt to include any that are excluded by default. How are averages calculated? Many of the rating items are asked on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being most negative and 5 being most positive. On individual reports, instructors are able to obtain averages for their course ratings alongside averages for their department, school, and University. All courses with 5 or greater responses are used as the base dataset in generating the average. For departments with cross-listed courses, departmental-level averages include courses at the level in which students registered. For instance, for DEPT ABC, all responses are separated out based on the corresponding course level (e.g., undergrad vs. graduate). Among cross-listed courses, the course level in which students registered are included based the course level (e.g., for course DEPT. ABC 231/331, students who registered via DEPT. ABC 331 will have their responses included in the DEPT. ABC-Graduate average). Department chairs and deans will see course averages computed on all responses, without a threshold in place.

Submit Search Query Academic Affairs Updates Course Evaluations ClarkEfolio Contact Us Academic Affairs Updates Course Evaluations ClarkEfolio Contact Us ClarkEfolio Home ClarkEfolio ClarkEfolio (Faculty 180) is a faculty activity records management system that provides a single convenient place for faculty members to archive their achievements. It replaces the old FAR reporting forms that faculty submitted via Microsoft Word Docs each year. Faculty members input their data about teaching, research, service, and other activities that are reported as part of the annual review process. Profile information, course data, and advising data are being brought into ClarkEfolio from Banner. Please review the below common questions that have been asked about this application. Login to Clarkefolio General Questions Are there any help documents available to Clark Faculty? Yes! We now have a ClarkEfolio Training Manual available to walk faculty through the process of entering their Annual Activities. The Goddard Library has created a handy cheatsheet for faculty interested in creating and uploading RIS files to ClarkEfolio. Departmental reviewers of faculty and department admins will find this how-to document helpful. Faculty submitting sabbatical requests will find Instructions for Faculty – Sabbatical Request helpful. Department admins uploading “binders” for COP can follow these directions. What is the Benefit to Faculty? Faculty members can generate custom CVs and bio sketches, as well as standard bio sketches for NSF and NIH proposals. In the future, Clark will be able to configure faculty website bios to automatically update from faculty achievements in ClarkEfolio. The ClarkEfolio system facilitates the annual review process at Clark. Faculty can view the annual review summary documents that are generated. ClarkEfolio saves faculty time because profile information, course data, and advising data are being brought into ClarkEfolio from Banner. Once faculty enter their scholarship and research activity, the university can use that information without having to repeatedly ask the faculty. The system is secure and only approved university administrators have access to the data. What is the ClarkEfolio platform? ClarkEfolio is supported by Interfolio’s Faculty180 product. Which browser should I use with ClarkEfolio? ClarkEfolio features work best in Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari browsers. Internet Explorer is not recommended because of issues with functionality and display. Please set your browser to accept pop-ups from the ClarkEfolio site to ensure an optimal experience. What data is currently pre-loaded into ClarkEfolio? In the Profile Section: Name and Email address Current position title Position start date Academic rank, tenure-status Degrees earned In the Activities Section: Student advising data Course data from Fall 2019 – present Other data that will be loaded in the future: Course Evaluation data How do I correct errors if the information is incorrect? You can edit records as you choose in the “Research: Scholarly Work and Creative Activity section.” Once a record is deleted, it cannot be retrieved, and would need to be manually re-entered. Other information is fed from systems that are considered official sources of record. In those cases, changes must occur at the source. If you notice errors in the Profile section, please send an email to ClarkieFolio@clarku.edu. If you notice errors in the courses taught or advising and mentoring sections, please email registrar@clarku.edu. Who has access to the ClarkEfolio system? Faculty and appointed personnel who are currently participating in the annual review process will have access to report their activities in the system. Deans, department heads and select administrative personnel will have the ability to view data and to generate reports for their respective colleges and departments. Information will be provided to the Provost’s Office as part of the annual review process. No other faculty members will be able to see your information. The single exception is the “Find Colleagues” function where faculty can use a keyword search in order to find colleagues with similar interests, for collaboration purposes. What is “emulation” and how do department administrators “emulate” faculty users in the system? Occasionally, faculty may ask department administrators to do data entry on their behalf. Emulation allows department administrators to view a particular faculty member’s data and enter data. To Emulate a faculty member: On the Admin section of the navigation menu, click Administration. In the Tools section, click Emulate User. The Emulate User screen displays. Locate the user you wish to emulate by using the filters in the Count By Unit section, then selecting your unit. The results display in the Search Names Below field. If necessary, use the search field to locate the desired user within the search results. Upon locating the desired user, click the user’s name. A confirmation message opens. Click OK. You are now emulating the selected user. Can I access a help page for Faculty 180? Yes, Interfolio has a help page for Faculty 180. The following resources are general for all Faculty180 products and not specific to Clark’s version, but they may be helpful. For Faculty: https://product-help.interfolio.com/m/68320 For Administrators: https://product-help.interfolio.com/m/68329 Videos and webinars: https://product-help.interfolio.com/en_US/webinars-and-videos How can I get help on the ClarkEfolio system? If faculty have questions about entering their activities or information, which category to use for a specific activity, etc., they are encouraged to seek assistance from their department administrators, Chairs, or Amy Lee in the Provost’s Office. If a user is experiencing issues with logging in, browsers, or printing, contact the Clark Helpdesk. For Faculty How do I know what information to enter in ClarkEfolio? We’ve modeled the Activity section after the old Microsoft Word FAR reports, so you should be able to log your activities in similarly-titled sections. There is also contextual help for each field in an activity section, indicated by a blue circle with a question mark. Clicking on the question mark will open the help dialog box for more information about that field. Can I import my scholarship activities from Google Scholar or another source? Yes, after you have logged into Google Scholar, you can easily export or copy your citations and then import or paste them into ClarkEfolio. Further directions and screenshots can be found on the Faculty 180 help page: https://product-help.interfolio.com/m/68320/l/726114-scholarly-contributions-and-creative-productions-import-citations-using-the-generic-import General help for faculty entering Scholarly Contributions: https://product-help.interfolio.com/m/71514/l/777971-faculty-input-scholarly-contributions-video How do faculty “submit” their activities for annual review? While faculty can enter and update activities in ClarkEfolio all year round, a submit button is only available from an initiated activity input form. This form is created by the Provost’s Office for the faculty annual review period in the spring. The initiated activity input form is important in the review process, as it gives faculty guidance on the activities that will be under review, as well as an opportunity to see these activities from the evaluator’s point of view. They can do this by using the form’s Preview CV button. How can I print a CV from ClarkEfolio? Using the menu on the left side of the screen, select Vitas & Biosketches Open the vita for viewing by choosing the View icon to the right of the vita (CV) that you would like to print. Select the Print button. On the next web page, press CTRL+P to send the page to your local printer. After the page loads, it should show the name of the user that you are emulating at the top of the screen in a red box. To exit the emulation, click Exit Emulation at the top-right corner of the screen. Have a Question? Feel free to contact Amy Lee in the Provost’s Office.
