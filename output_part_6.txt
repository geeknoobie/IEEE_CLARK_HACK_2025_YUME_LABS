Clark University is committed to providing a learning and working environment free of discrimination, harassment, or violence. The University encourages individuals to come forward if they have experienced any form of sexual misconduct, discrimination, harassment, or violence. For conduct that occurs after August 1, 2024, this Title IX Policy covers conduct including sex-based harassment, sex/gender discrimination, sexual assault, sexual violence, rape, stalking, and relationship violence (including domestic and dating violence), as well as harassment that targets a person based on gender identity, transgender identity, gender transition, or pregnancy. This policy covers conduct defined by the Title IX regulations issued by the Department of Education, as well as other conduct prohibited by Clark University. This Policy also contains the procedures that will be used when a report of prohibited conduct is made to the Clark University Title IX Office. This policy applies to all Clark University students, faculty, and staff. For conduct that occurred prior to August 1, 2024, this Sexual Offenses Policy covers conduct including sexual harassment, sex/gender discrimination, sexual assault, sexual violence, rape, stalking, and relationship violence (including domestic and dating violence), as well as harassment that targets a person based on gender identity, transgender identity, or gender transition. This policy covers conduct defined by the Title IX regulations issued by the Department of Education, as well as other conduct prohibited by Clark University. This Policy also contains the procedures that will be used when a report of prohibited conduct is made to the Clark University Title IX Office. This policy applies to all Clark University students, faculty, and staff. Download title ix policy and sexual misconduct process Please Note The party making an allegation of a sexual offense is considered a complainant and the party being accused is called a respondent. Definitions The definitions below can be found in Sections III and IV of the Sexual Offenses Policy. The Title IX regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Education require the University to apply specific definitions and procedures for conduct that is covered by those regulations. For definitions of Prohibited Conduct and procedures pertaining to conduct defined by the Title IX regulations see Appendix A of The Sexual Offenses Policy. Consent Incapacitation Relationship Violence Retaliation Sexual assault Sexual exploitation Sexual harassment Sexual misconduct Stalking Consent Effective, clear consent is defined as a freely and affirmatively communicated willingness to participate in sexual activity, expressed either by words or clear, unambiguous actions. It is the responsibility of the initiator of the sexual activity to ensure that they have the other person’s consent to engage in sexual activity. Consent to sexual activity may be withdrawn at any time, as long as the withdrawal is communicated clearly. Consent cannot be assumed because of the existence of a dating relationship between the persons involved or due to the existence of a previous sexual relationship between the persons. Silence, in and of itself, cannot be interpreted as consent. Consent must be present throughout the sexual activity by all parties involved. Consent to one form of sexual activity does not imply consent to other forms of sexual activity. The respondent or complainant’s use of alcohol or other drugs does not diminish the respondent’s responsibility. Consent may never be given by minors (in Massachusetts, those not yet sixteen [16] years of age), those who have a mental disability, those who are incapacitated as a result of alcohol or other drug consumption (voluntary and involuntary), or those who are unconscious, unaware, or otherwise physically helpless. Incapacitation Incapacitation is the lack of physical or intellectual capability to consent. Being incapacitated differs from being intoxicated or drunk. A person who is incapacitated cannot understand the fact, nature, or extent of sexual activity. Incapacitation may be a result of consuming alcohol, drugs, or other intoxicating substances, being unconscious or asleep, and/or other factors that could alter one’s faculties. It is a violation of this Policy to engage in sexual activity with a person who is incapacitated, regardless of whether the person appeared to be a willing participant. Relationship Violence Relationship violence (including domestic, dating, and intimate partner violence) is violent or controlling behavior by a person who is currently or was previously in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the Complainant. Relationship violence includes actual or threatened physical injury, sexual assault, psychological abuse, economic control, controlling/possessive behavior and/or progressive social isolation, threatening self-harm if the other partner leaves the relationship; destroying property, or monitoring a partner’s calls and emails in order to manipulate or isolate. Retaliation The University will not tolerate retaliation in any form against any persons for their participation or involvement in the reporting, investigation, and/or resolution of matters subject to the Sexual Offenses Policy and Process. The University will take appropriate steps to prevent and/or address retaliatory conduct immediately. Retaliation includes any acts or words that constitute intimidation, threats, or coercion because of that person’s (1) report of Policy violation(s); (2) assistance in reporting of Policy violation(s); (3) participation in any proceeding under the policy; or (4) protest of Policy conduct, and that would also deter a reasonable person from reporting or assisting in reporting a violation of the policy, participating in any proceeding under the policy, or protesting of the Policy. Sexual Assault Sexual assault is any sexual penetration (anal, oral, or vaginal), however slight, with any object or sexual intercourse by one or more persons upon another without effective consent. Sexual penetration includes vaginal or anal penetration by a penis, object, tongue, or finger, and oral copulation by mouth-to-genital contact or genital-to-mouth contact. Sexual Exploitation Sexual exploitation occurs when a person takes non-consensual or abusive sexual advantage of another for their own advantage or benefit, or to benefit or advantage anyone other than the one being exploited, and that behavior does not otherwise constitute sexual assault, sexual misconduct, or sexual harassment. Examples of sexual exploitation include, but are not limited to: making public sexual activity with another person without that other person’s consent; prostituting another person; non-consensual video- or audio-taping of sexual activity; going beyond the boundaries of consent (such as letting your friends hide in the closet to watch you having consensual sex); voyeurism; and/or knowingly transmitting a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or HIV to another person. Sexual Harassment Sexual harassment consists of any unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. This includes, but is not limited to: submission to, or rejection of, such conduct that is made either implicitly or explicitly a term or condition of employment or participation in an education program; submission to, or rejection of, such conduct that is used as the basis for employment or academic decisions affecting a student, faculty, or staff member; such conduct that has the purpose or effect of interfering with a student, faculty, or staff member’s work or academic performance; or such conduct that creates a hostile or intimidating work or academic environment and is severe, pervasive or objectively offensive. Please Note: Consistent with Title IX Federal Regulations, Appendix A includes a different definition of Sexual Harassment that is applicable when the Title IX Coordinator determines that a complaint falls under Appendix A and will be handled using Appendix A. Sexual Misconduct Sexual misconduct is any intentional sexual touching of a person, however slight, with any object without effective consent. Sexual touching includes any bodily contact with the breasts, groin, genitals, mouth, or another bodily orifice of another or any other bodily contact in a sexual manner. Any disrobing of, or exposure to, another person without effective consent is considered a violation of this policy. Stalking on the Basis of Sex Stalking is a course of conduct (two or more acts) directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to a) fear for their safety or the safety of others or b) suffer substantial emotional distress. Stalking behaviors include, but are not limited to: non-consensual communication (including in-person communication, telephone calls, voice/text/email messages, social networking site postings, instant messages, postings of pictures or information on websites, written letters, gifts, or any other communications that are undesired and/or place another person in fear); following, pursuing, waiting, or showing up uninvited at a workplace, place of residence, classroom, or other locations frequented by a person; surveillance and other types of observation, whether by physical proximity or electronic means; vandalism; trespassing; nonconsensual touching; direct physical or verbal threats against a person and/or their loved ones; gathering of information about a person from family friends, co-workers, and/or classmates; manipulative and controlling behaviors such as threats to harm oneself or threats to harm someone close to that person; and defamation or slander against a person. Additionally Prohibited Conduct Aiding or Facilitating a Sexual Offense Aiding or facilitating a sexual offense means promoting or encouraging the commission of any behavior prohibited under this policy. Members of the Clark community are prohibited both from personally engaging in sexual offenses, and also from engaging in conduct which assists or encourages another person to engage in such misconduct. Attempted Violations In most circumstances, Clark University will treat attempts to commit any of the violations listed in this policy as if those attempts had been completed. False Reports Clark University will not tolerate intentional false reporting of incidents. It is a violation of the Student Code of Conduct to make an intentionally false report of any policy violation, and it may also violate state criminal statutes and civil defamation laws.

Detailed below are some guidelines that can help complainants, respondents, and friends and loved-ones of people involved in these situations. The below tips are not a comprehensive list of ways to interact with people affected by sexual violence, but these guidelines can help navigate this difficult time in your life. Definitions Complainant A Complainant is the person reporting conduct that may have violated the Sexual Offense Policies Respondent A Respondent is the person being accused of violating the Sexual Offense Policies Complainant Methods to help support a friend who has experienced sexual violence People who experience sexual violence often disclose that information to a friend. While hearing this can be very confusing it is important that you have tools to help your friend. You might also be experiencing many different emotions, from sadness, to anger and fear, this is all normal. While you cannot change what happened you can help your friend through their healing process by being supportive. Below are some suggestions about how to help your friend. Remember you must also take care of your own wellbeing during this time. Supporting a friend who discloses to you may be difficult and require extra emotional labor if you have firsthand experience with sexual violence. There is no perfect response for when a friend tells you that they have experienced sexual violence. Your friend has trusted you, try to respond with support and care: Create a safe, judgment-free environment Let your friend do the talking, do not push them or attempt to automatically find a solution. Make sure they know you are comfortable with them turning to you. Silence in these conversations is normal Allow them to set the pace. Letting your friend know that you are comfortable with them telling you. Don’t interrogate your friend about the situation or ask “why” questions This may make them uncomfortable and will make them think you do not believe them. Do not tell them what you wish they had done or not done differently, this may be seen as unhelpful or unsupportive. Asking “why” questions can sound like you are blaming them for what happened and may upset your friend further. For example don’t ask “why they had so much to drink” or “why they went back to someone’s room” It is not your job to decide what occurred Your friend said they were hurt, that should be enough for you to support them. Be respectful of their privacy Do not talk to or tell anyone about what happened without their permission. Only tell someone who you can trust to help if you believe they, you, or the community is still in danger. Help them find information about their resources Knowing where to turn for Counseling services, medical attention, evidence preservation, and reporting is important. Do not force them to follow any of these options but make sure they know the range of possibilities. Resources can be found here: https://bit.ly/2JAMGgq Let your friend make their own decisions You can provide information and advice, but it is ultimately their decision about what they want to do moving forward. Help your friend feel confident in their own decision-making. Ask them what they need from you Do not assume what they want or need. Respect what they tell you. If they do not want certain types of help that is their right, do not force it upon them. Respect their decisions. Offer to join them at meetings or appointments When going to seek support, medical attention, or file a report with the Title IX office or police your friend might not want to be alone. If they do want to go alone, let them! Be empathetic not sympathetic While you may not have the same experiences as them you can empathize with what they are experiencing. Saying things like “it could have been worse” or “it’s going to be alright” are sympathetic responses that overlook what your friend might be feeling. Using phrases like “I am sorry this happened to you” or “How can I help you right now?” are empathy based responses and will let your friend know you understand the gravity of the situation. Make sure your friend knows that they are not alone Assure them that this experience does not change your relationship with them. That you care about them and will be there for them as much as you can. Balance being there for your friend and giving them space Your friend is going through a difficult time and may need to spend time alone. Respect their time and space and always make sure to ask before hugging or making physical contact with them. Reporting Options View Flow Chart Download Text Version Respondent Methods to help support a friend accused of sexual assault If a friend discloses they have been accused of sexual assault, it is normal to be confused and have questions. You might also be experiencing many different emotions, from sadness, to betrayal, this is all normal. Your friend might be reaching out for support and it is okay if you are unsure of how to respond to them. You can help your friend find the information and/or support they are looking for without condoning their alleged behavior. Here are some ways you can help your friend: Lead them to resources: Educate yourself on Sexual and Relationship Violence Understanding what your friend talking about will make you more able to support them during this process. It is not your job to determine what happened, but it is important that you understand the situation. Be honest with your limitations on providing/being there for support Everyone has a threshold of how much support they can provide for someone else. Make sure to be aware of your own personal limitations. Encourage your friend to reach out to professional resources so that they can receive the support they are looking for. Be respectful of privacy and confidentiality. Do not talk to or tell anyone about what happened without their permission. Only tell someone who you can trust to help if you believe they, you, or the community is still in danger. Let your friend do the talking, do not push them or attempt to automatically find a solution. While you want to help them understand and/or fix the situation this is not your responsibility. Let your friend process what is happening without jumping into problem solving. Silence in these conversations is normal Allow them to set the pace. Be a good listener and do not try to fill up the silence. Let your friend make their own decisions. You can provide information and advice, but it is ultimately their decision about what they want to do moving forward. Help your friend feel confident in their own decision-making. Ask them what they need from you. Do not assume what they want or need. Respect what they tell you. If they do not want certain types of help that is their right, do not force it upon them. Respect their decisions. Offer to join them when they are in related meetings. Remember, helping your friend does NOT mean: You should harass or threaten other people involved in the situation. Helping your friend find resources and support does not mean you approve or condone their alleged actions. How to take care of yourself while supporting someone else: Educate yourself about sexual and relationship violence Knowing what your friend is talking about and the challenges they are facing as a Complainant or Respondent will help you support them. Take time and be conscious about your own responses to sexual violence It is normal to have a strong reaction when learning about violence a friend has experienced or been accused of, especially if you or someone else in your life has experience with similar situations. Be compassionate with yourself, it is okay to be confused, angry, or scared. If you are struggling with this situation reach out to someone you trust, or a counselor at CPG. It is important that you also have someone to talk to. While you cannot change what is happening with your friend, you can help through this process, but only if you are taking care of yourself. Remember the most important thing is what the survivor wants for themselves, not what you want for them While your intentions are in the right place it is important to recognize that what might make you feel better might not be helpful to your friend. Placing their needs and wants above your own desires for retaliation or your ideas about what we help them most, will be the most beneficial to your friend in the long run. If you do not know what would be most helpful, ask them! Know your limitations You can only give as much as you are capable of. Not being able to provide your friend with all the support they require does not make you a bad friend or a failure. In order to be a good support system you must be taking care of yourself. Make sure your friend has several support options that they can turn to. Let your friend know you will not be hurt by them also talking to someone else, and that you want them to be surrounded by a strong support network. If you are feeling overwhelmed seek out support The same services you were offering your friend are available to you! Find a counselor at CPG or stop by the Title IX office. Just because you did not experience the violence yourself does not mean it does not affect you. Your health and wellbeing is also important. Find a support system, and make sure to continue to respect your friend’s privacy even as you seek help.

Submit Search Query Policy and Process How To Help a Friend Resources Click to open menu. Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Policy and Process How To Help a Friend Resources Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Frequently Asked Questions Home Resources Frequently Asked Questions We hope we can answer some of your questions with some of the frequently asked questions below: What is Title IX and whom does it protect? Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 requires all federally funded Universities to prohibit sex/gender-based discrimination on campuses. Title IX states, “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” (TITLE IX OF THE EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1972, 20 U.S.C. A§ 1681 ET. SEQ.) Title IX protects everyone, regardless of, race/ethnicity, color, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, class, religion, citizenship, marriage status, pregnant or parenting status, or age as define by law, national origin, disability, or veteran status. Title IX applies to all students, staff and faculty, this includes female, male, transgender, and gender non-conforming Clark University community members. What happens when the University finds out about an occurrence of conduct that might violate the Sexual Offense Policy? After receiving a report of conduct that could fall under the Sexual Offense Policy, the Title IX Coordinator or their designee will take a number of initial steps. These initial steps are not an investigation. Rather, these initial steps will enable the University to assess the need to take any immediate action, to address the safety and health needs of the Complainant and the University community, and to determine the next steps for investigating the reported conduct and the need for any interim measures. The Title IX Coordinator will contact the Complainant and encourage them to meet to discuss the nature and circumstances of the reported conduct, review relevant documentation that is available, and address their immediate physical safety and emotional needs, including the need for any interim measures. Examples of interim measures may include: no-contact orders requests for academic adjustments changes to living, transportation and working situations, other actions to address the situations and concerns raised on an interim basis. What is the difference between a “Complainant” and a “Respondent”? In a Title IX context the “Complainant” is the person reporting a potential violation of the Sexual Offense Policy and the “Respondent” is the person accused of violating the Sexual Offense Policy. Who can a student talk to if they have been accused of committing a Sexual Offense? If you or someone you know has been accused of committing a Sexual Offense there are a few different resources. The student can speak to: Brittany RendeTitle IX Coordinatortitleix@clarku.edushe/her/hers1-508-793-7194 How does the Title IX Process work if the Respondent is a faculty or staff member? If a student is reporting a Title IX case where the Respondent is a faculty or staff member, the Title IX Procedure follows the guidelines set forth in the Faculty or Staff Sexual Offense Policy respectively. To learn more about that process follow this link https://www.clarku.edu/offices/title-ix/policy-and-process/. To see the staff and faculty policies follow this link https://www.clarku.edu/offices/title-ix/policy-and-process/. Can I receive assistance and resources from the Title IX office even if I do not want to report an incident? Yes. You may receive assistance and resources from the Title IX office even if you are not reporting an incident. These may include: housing changes, schedule changes, medical assistance or counseling services. Can I bring someone with me to the Title IX office? Yes. Both Complainants and Respondents are allowed to bring a support person, or advisor to the Title IX office with them. Complainants and Respondents are allowed an advisor for all parts of the Title IX process. What kind of resources can Clark provide for me? Clark can provide students resources such as, academic assistance, work assistance, housing changes, no contact orders, financial assistance, counseling services, and medical care. Clark University can also provide individual assistance depending on the circumstances. If I was drinking underage or using drugs when the incident occurred will I be punished? Or if I was drinking or using drugs when I witnessed and reported an incident will I be punished? No. Clark University has a Medical Amnesty Policy. Under this policy, Clark will not write you up for a drinking or drug conduct violation if you are experiencing a medical emergency, are reporting a possible sexual offense violation, or calling for someone else experiencing such action. What is a no-contact order? A no-contact order is an order issued by the University to protect a person’s safety and preserve a peaceful environment for all students to work, study and live on campus. If you have been issued a no-contact order it may limit communication in person, electronic, through social media or a third party. Violations of a university no-contact order may result in separation from the University. What and who are Responsible Employees? A Responsible Employee are employees of the University who are mandated by law to promptly report any information they encounter regarding a possible sexual offense to the Title IX Coordinator or their supervisor. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 defines “responsible employees” as those employees who: have the authority to take action to redress harassment have the duty to report to appropriate school officials’ sexual harassment or any other misconduct by students or employees or who a student could reasonably believe has this authority or responsibility At Clark University, all employees, including Teaching Assistants (TAs) and Resident Advisors (RAs), are responsible employees and are required to report information about a possible sexual offense. Responsible employees help connect students to their campus resources.

Tuition Exchange Program Overview Clark University is a member of the Tuition Exchange (TE) Program, which provides the opportunity for dependent children of eligible Clark faculty and staff to receive undergraduate scholarships at other participating TE member institutions. A list of 600+ colleges and universities that participate in the TE program can be viewed at www.tuitionexchange.org. The TE program is a scholarship opportunity and not a fringe benefit provided by Clark University. Only full time faculty and staff who have completed five (5) years of full time employment at Clark (as of September 1st of the year of application), are eligible to apply on behalf of their dependent children. Application for the TE program does not guarantee acceptance at a TE member institution, nor does it insure a TE scholarship. Due to the TE application process as well as the timing of admissions decisions, TE scholarship applications are due in the HR Office no later than the last workday in October each year. Because of the multi step process of this scholarship opportunity, faculty and staff who intend to apply are strongly encourage to attend the annual TE Information Session with representatives of financial aid, and human resources held in early October. Frequently Asked Questions Q. What is the Tuition Exchange (TE) Program? A. The Tuition Exchange is a reciprocal scholarship program where participating member schools are required to offer a minimum “set rate” value scholarship to students they admit with a TE scholarship award. The scholarship amount will be provided on the TE Scholarship application each year. Q. Who is eligible to apply for a Tuition Exchange Scholarship Certification from Clark? A. You are eligible to apply if you are a regular full-time Clark faculty or staff member who has completed five years of full-time employment as of September 1st of the year of application; are actively working; and are on Clark’s payroll. If you applied last year and did not receive a TE scholarship, you must apply for certification from Clark again this year. Q. What are my chances of being certified eligible by Clark University for TE consideration? A. There is no guarantee. The TE program is not a Clark University benefit, so you are not automatically eligible to receive certification. Q. How does my dependent student become eligible for a TE Scholarship? A. There are two steps in the process: The faculty/staff member must submit a “TE Application to Participate” form to the Clark HR Office for initial determination of the faculty/staff member’s eligibility to participate. If the faculty/staff member is eligible the employee will be notified by HR. Once the employee is notified that their student has received the opportunity to participate in the TE scholarship program it is the student’s responsibility to notify Tuition Exchange by completing the EZ Online Application on the TE portal. Please note that the student will need to create an account on the portal before they are able to access the EZ Online Application. When your student is admitted to one or more of the colleges they have identified on the TE EZ Online Application the admitting college determines whether or not to award a TE Scholarship to your student. Please note: It is possible for you to be eligible at Clark; to be certified by Clark; and still not receive a TE scholarship from the school of choice that your student is admitted to. Being certified by Clark is not a guarantee that your student will receive a TE scholarship from the admitting school. Q. What are my chances that the TE College will award my dependent child a scholarship once eligible? A. It depends on the participating TE colleges’ policies and procedures, and the number of scholarships it has available. Last year, TE colleges that were new to TE, or were very large TE institutions, were more likely to offer a TE scholarship. Also, if the number of TE applicants to a particular TE college is small, chances will be better to get an award. Q. When should I apply to Clark to participate? A. You should submit an “Application to Participate” to the Clark HR Office no later than October 31st of the year prior to the academic year that your dependent student is considering attending college. TE applications may be accepted after that date, but will be certified on a space available basis. Q. What is the value of a TE Scholarship? A. TE colleges are required to cover up to a minimum amount of their charged tuition (this is called minimum “set rate” value). Each year the Tuition Exchange Board of Directors establishes the set rate value amount based on a weighted average of all participating TE College tuitions. This means that the set rate value could change each year. Q. What happens if too many students apply for TE at a particular TE college? A. Each participating TE college determines whom they will accept for admission and how many students they will offer a TE Scholarship to. Each school’s criteria used could include but is not limited to SAT scores, class rank, teacher recommendations, activities, financial need, and employee length of service. Q. Can my student receive a TE Scholarship and use Clark’s Off Campus tuition benefit at the same time? A. No. Your student is eligible to receive either the TE scholarship or Clark University’s Off-campus tuition benefit (if eligible) within a given semester, but not both at the same time. There is a limit of eight total semesters, or the attainment of a bachelor’s degree, whichever comes first, of combined usage in both programs. Q. Who administers Clark’s TE program? A. Clark’s Director of Financial Assistance acts as the Tuition Exchange Liaison Officer responsible for the administration of the program. The Human Resources Office is responsible for the determination of your eligibility to participate, and for maintaining Clark’s TE policies. Q. Is there anything else I should know about TE? A. It is the employee’s responsibility to ensure applications have been submitted to the participating institutions of your choice. It is also a good idea to apply for financial aid at the same time your student applies for admission in case the participating TE College does not offer your student a TE Scholarship. If your student waits to find out if they have been awarded a TE scholarship before applying for financial aid, it may be too late to do so when they receive the decision about the TE scholarship. Also, even if a TE Scholarship is offered, your student may still be eligible for financial aid beyond the TE Scholarship. Please make sure you apply for financial aid when you apply for admissions to a participating TE school. Q. Where can I get more information about TE? A. Connect to the Internet www.tuitionexchange.org to review a current list of participating TE institutions. If you have questions about TE at another school, contact the Admissions Office at that specific school. If you have questions about your eligibility for participation in this program, please contact the HR office; or if you have questions about the TE certification process, please contact Clark’s Financial Aid Office. * The IRS definition of a qualified dependent is: a) they live with you for more than one-half of the taxable year; and (b) unless disabled, they are under age 19 if not a student, or under age 24 and is a full-time student at least 5 months out of the year; and (c) they do not provide more than one-half of their own support. benefit forms more benefits Clark’s Perks Showcase There are lots of great benefits to working at Clark University.

This list does not comprise all of Clark’s policies and guidelines. Please review the University Policies webpage for additional policies. If you have a question about a policy or procedure not listed, please contact a staff member in Human Resources at hr@clarku.edu or 1-508-793-7294. Acceptance of Gifts and Hospitality from External Parties Guidelines Clark University is committed to the utmost integrity in fulfilling its mission and thereby requires the same level of integrity from its employees. The acceptance of Gifts or Hospitality or other benefits may improperly influence an employee in their discharge of official duties or create the perception that the employee is receiving personal gain by virtue of their position at the University. These guidelines provide Clark’s expectation on employees accepting Gifts and Hospitality from external sources. Departments and units may impose more stringent procedures, as they deem appropriate and necessary, to preserve the University’s integrity. View Full Policy Animals on Campus Policy This policy extends to all Clark University members, including undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, staff, and administrators: All dogs must be on leashes at all times when on Clark University property. Dog waste must be cleaned up by the person with the dog at the time. No animals will be allowed in University buildings at any time. The only exception will be seeing-eye dogs and hearing-assist dogs. Violations of any of the above policies will result in a fine of $50 for the first offense; the fine will jump to $100 for a subsequent offense. Persistent problems may be dealt with judicially for students or through appropriate means for non-students. Background Check Policy and Guidelines To ensure the safety of the Clark community, Clark must conduct background checks on individuals seeking employment at Clark and, under certain circumstances, current employees, students, independent contractors, and volunteers (i.e. individuals not being paid for services). View Full Policy Clark University Protests and Demonstrations Policy The right to freedom of expression at Clark includes the right to acts of peaceful dissent, nonviolent protests, and orderly demonstrations including picketing and the distribution of leaflets. This document outlines the University policies that govern such expression. View Full Policy Clark University Statement of Freedom of Expression and Community Values This statement of principles articulates Clark University’s commitments and ideals relating to freedom of expression and academic freedom, respect for each other within our campus community, and freedom from harassment and intimidation. View Full Policy Chosen Name Policy This policy covers active students, faculty and staff. The University recognizes that some community members wish to use a name other than a legal FIRST name to identify themselves. The University refers to this as a chosen name. As long as the use of this chosen name is not for the purpose of misrepresentation or an attempt to avoid a legal obligation, or otherwise prohibited by law, the University will display a chosen name in place of your legal FIRST name whenever possible. The University is working towards a consistent name experience across University systems and the use of chosen name everywhere, except when legal name is necessary or when there are technological limitation. View Full Policy Conflict of Interest Policy Statement The Clark University Conflict of Interest Policy Statement covers all members of the Board of Trustees, all officers and “key employees” of the University, and is also intended to provide a framework for all faculty, employees, and volunteers in their service to the University. All trustees, officers, and key employees have a fiduciary duty to the University, and are expected to act at all times in a manner consistent with this duty, and to ensure that none of their actions on behalf of Clark adversely impacts the University because of other business or personal interests of that person. All such covered persons are expected to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws pertaining to Clark activities; to conduct themselves with integrity and high ethical standards; and to avoid any conflict or appearance of a conflict between their own interests and those of the University. View Full Policy Consenting Relationships Policy Consensual romantic and sexual relationships between staff and students or between supervisors and staff members are strongly discouraged, and cause special concerns with respect to the existence or appearance of exploitation, abuse of position, or favoritism. All employees should understand that there are substantial risks in even an apparently consenting relationship where a power/authority difference exists. These relationships can and often do lead to charges of sexual harassment, or violation of our nepotism policy. Administrators and supervisors, who by virtue of their level of responsibility and authority, bear a special burden of accountability. The University reserves the right to make employment changes if romantic relationships develop between employees and/or students that appear problematic. View Full Policy Drug-Free Workplace Policy An accordance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1989, Clark University prohibits the unlawful cultivation, manufacturing, dispensing, distribution, possession, use or sale of illicit drugs (including marijuana) and the abuse of alcohol in the workplace. Please also note that both the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act explicitly exclude illegal drug use from being protected as a reasonable accommodation. In addition, the appendix to M.G.L. c. 94C (Humanitarian Medical Use of Medical Marijuana), specifically states that nothing in that law requires the violation of federal law or purports to give immunity under federal law. In summary, marijuana is still prohibited under federal law regardless of legal changes with respect to marijuana possession and usage in Massachusetts. As a condition of employment, each faculty and staff member must abide by this policy. Violation of this policy may result in a variety of sanctions up to and including discharge from the University. The University provides a drug and alcohol counseling and rehabilitation program through its Employee’s Assistance Program (EAP). This program is available to all faculty and staff and their families. Additional information on this resource is available in the Office of Human Resources. As part of the Drug-Free Workplace Act requirements, if a faculty or staff member is convicted of any criminal drug statute violation in the workplace, he/she must report this conviction to the Office of Human Resources within five (5) days following conviction. Risks The consequences associated with the use of illegal drugs or the abuse of alcohol range from adverse impact on social, vocational, and educational functioning to illness, injury, and premature death. Abusers are more likely to experience problems in their relationships and typically cause harm to those closest to them — family, friends and colleagues. Health risks vary considerably depending on the nature of the abused substance but all drugs pose serious health risks. Some, such as cocaine, can cause serious harm even on first use. In Massachusetts, the penalties for the use, sale, or possession of illegal drugs range from fines and probation to mandatory jail sentences. Varieties of federal laws exist on the possession, use, sale, and manufacture of illegal drugs. As with state law, the federal sanctions may result in fines or imprisonment. The use or possession of alcohol by minors, those under 21, is illegal in Massachusetts. International students and visitors at Clark risk loss of the right to remain in the United States if convicted. Family or staff in sensitive positions would risk loss of their security clearance. A detailed description of the adverse effects of drug and alcohol abuse, as well as a summary of local, state, and federal sanctions covering such abuse, are included with this document. The Effects of Alcohol Abuse Alcohol consumption causes a number of marked changes in behavior. Even low doses can significantly impair the judgment and coordination required driving a car safely, increasing the likelihood that the driver will be involved in an accident. Low to moderate doses of alcohol can also increase the incidence of a variety of aggressive acts, including spouse and child abuse. Moderate to high doses of alcohol cause marked impairment in higher mental functions, severely altering a person’s ability to learn and remember information. Very high doses cause illness, depression and death. If combined with other depressants of the central nervous system, much lower doses of alcohol will produce the effects just described. Repeated use of alcohol can lead to dependence. Sudden cessation of alcohol intake is likely to produce withdrawal symptoms, including severe anxiety, tremors, hallucinations, and convulsions. Alcohol withdrawal can be life-threatening. Long-term consumption of large quantities of alcohol, particularly when combined with poor nutrition, can also lead to permanent damage to vital organs such as the brain and liver. Mothers who drink alcohol during pregnancy may give birth to infants with fetal alcohol syndrome. These infants have irreversible physical abnormalities and mental retardation. In addition, research indicates that children of alcoholic parents are at greater of becoming alcoholics. Services An array of services is available to assist persons who may be concerned about his or her use of drugs or alcohol. Most of these services will assist faculty, staff, and family members whose concern is for a loved one or a colleague. The services range from self-help groups (AA, NA, AL-ANON) to professional counseling. Arrangements can be made for consultants, interventions, detoxification, and aftercare. From time to time, Clark will also introduce to the community other education programs about drug and alcohol abuse and provide training in identifying and addressing the problems of drug and alcohol abuse. Timely assistance is important for those who may be abusing drugs or alcohol.Clark urges anyone who needs assistance to seek it. Alcohol and drug abuse services are private and confidential. Delaying necessary help is invariably harmful and makes success in rehabilitation more difficult. Clark University’s Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is managed by an off campus agency, E4Health. The staff at E4Health can provide both assessment and referral services to faculty and staff (as well as family members) who self-refer for treatment or advice on drug and alcohol abuse. In addition, they can provide information and education of the types and effects of drugs, symptoms of drug or alcohol use as well as related treatment, rehabilitation and confidentiality issues. You may access this confidential service by calling the following number and identifying yourself as a member of Clark University’s faculty or staff (or a family member): 1-800-828-6025, or by visiting the website at: https://hello4health.org/ Username: Clark University Password: Guest Self-Help Groups Narcotics Anonymous (NA, 508- 756-2284): Twelve-step, self-help group that assists those attempting to recover from the abuse of drugs (not confined to narcotic drugs). Meetings are available in more area towns. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA, 508-752-9000): Twelve–step, self-help group that assists those attempting to recover from alcoholism. Meetings are generally available on campus and in area towns. AL-ANON (508-791-3431): Twelve-step, self-help group that assists those who are in a relationship with an alcoholic person. The relationship may be ongoing or from the past. Typically attended by persons whose parents or spouse are alcoholic. Meetings are available in most area towns. AdCare Hospital of Worcester, 107 Lincoln Street, (508-799-9000) For specific information of the wide array of substance abuse recovery services offered by AdCare please refer to: Summary of Legal sanctions Covering Alcohol and Drug Abuse Local, state, and federal laws make illegal use of drugs and alcohol serious crimes. Conviction can lead to imprisonment, fines and assigned community service. Courts do not lift imprisonment sentences in order for convicted persons to attend college or continue their jobs. A felony conviction for such an offense can prevent you from entering many fields of employment or professions. Cities and towns in Massachusetts prohibit public consumption of alcohol and impose fines for violation. The Metropolitan District Commission also prohibits public consumption of alcohol in its parks. Massachusetts’s laws prohibit sale or delivery of alcoholic beverages to persons under 21 with a fine of up to $2,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year or both. Misrepresenting one’s age or falsifying an identification to obtain alcoholic beverages is punishable by a fine of $300, and conviction of driving under the influence of alcohol has a fine of not less than $500 nor more than $5,000 or by imprisonment for not more than 2 ½ years, or both. Massachusetts has criminal penalties for use of controlled substances, or drugs, with penalties varying with the type of drug. In general, narcotic, addictive drugs with a high potential for abuse have heavier penalties. Possession of drugs is illegal without valid authorization. While penalties for possession are generally not as great as for manufacture and distribution of drugs, possession of a relatively large quantity may be considered distribution. Under both state and federal laws, penalties for possession, manufacture and distribution are much greater for second and subsequent convictions. Many laws dictate mandatory prison terms and the full minimum term must be served. Massachusetts makes it illegal to be in a place where heroin is kept and to be “in company” of a person known to possess heroin. Anyone in the presence of heroin at a private party or dormitory suite risks a serious drug conviction. Sale and possession of “drug paraphernalia” is illegal in Massachusetts. Persons convicted of drug possession under state or federal law are ineligible for federal student grants and loans for up to one year after the first conviction, five years after the second. The penalty for distributing drugs is loss of benefits for five years after the first, 10 years after the second, permanently after the third conviction. Under federal law, distribution of drugs to persons under age 21 is punishable by twice the normal penalty with a mandatory one-year in prison; a third conviction is punishable by mandatory life imprisonment. These penalties apply to distribution of drugs in or within 1,000 feet of a college or school. Federal law sets greatly heightened prison sentences for manufacture and distribution of drugs, if death or serious injury results from use of the substance. Emotional Support Animal Request – Policy and Procedure Clark University is committed to reasonably accommodating qualified employees with disabilities who may require the use of an Emotional Support Animal (ESA). Emotional Support Animals can also be identified as therapy or comfort animals, but will be referred to as ESAs in this policy. Clark reserves the right to amend this policy as circumstances require. Emotional Support Animals are not service animals, as defined in the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA). Please review the full policy via the link below (includes definitions, criteria, responsibilities, documentation requirements and how to submit a request for an ESA in a University department, building or office). View Full Policy Employee Birth/Adoption or Condolence Acknowledgement Policy Clark will acknowledge the birth, adoption and passing of an employee’s immediate family members. Should you be made aware of one of the above-listed events, please contact the Office of Human Resources who will recognize the event by sending the employee an appropriate acknowledgment. The purpose of this policy is to avoid department funds being utilized for this type of occasion. Please also reference the Entertainment and Gift Policy. View Full Policy Employee Indemnification Policy Clark shall furnish an employee with legal defense through legal counsel selected by the University and with payment of judgments, fines, penalties, settlements and any other expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with an actual or threatened civil, criminal, or administrative action, claim, or proceeding (an “Action”) brought against such employee by reason of being an employee of the University or serving at the University’s request as a member of or representative to an entity outside the University. View Full Policy Essential Personnel Limited On-Campus Operations Pay Policy On occasion the University may decide to limit on-campus operations and activities due to conditions that make it harder for faculty and staff to commute to work and deliver in person instruction and services. Events which might require limiting on-campus operations include, but are not limited to: Severe weather or natural disaster Fire or related hazard Immediate threat to the safety of the campus community Employees identified by their unit as performing essential service to the campus community are required to report to work during any period of declared limited on-campus operation. There may be employees in essential positions where it may be feasible to work remotely during limited on-campus operations. For clarification employees should consult with their supervisors. View Full Policy Equal Opportunity Statement Clark University is firmly committed to the practice of equal employment opportunity, equal educational opportunity, and nondiscrimination in the provision of educational and other services. The University will administer its personnel policies and conduct its employment practices in a manner which treats each employee and applicant for employment on the basis of merit, experience, and other work-related criteria without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, sexual orientation, disability, or any other protected class under relevant state and federal laws. Procedures have been established that outline our good faith efforts in practicing equal employment opportunity. Clark is committed to undertake steps to ensure that all recruitment, hiring, promotion and other employment and educational practices are free from discrimination. Equal opportunity is the fabric of all personnel decisions at Clark, and personnel at every level share in the responsibility for promoting equal opportunity. Faculty Parental Leave Policy Tenured or tenured-track faculty members, as well as faculty members holding Lectureships as defined in section I.D.2 (b) of the Faculty Handbook, are eligible to apply for a parental leave after one year of continuous full time employment at Clark University. View Full Policy Freedom of Expression and Community Values Statement This statement of principles articulates Clark University’s ideals relating to freedom of expression and academic freedom, respect for each other within our campus community, and freedom from harassment and intimidation. View Full Statement Harassment and Discrimination Prevention Policy Clark University reaffirms its commitment to employ a diverse faculty and staff and to a policy of affirmative action directed at increasing the presence of minority group members in the belief that a diverse Clark community is essential to our educational goals. It is the policy of Clark University that each qualified individual, regardless of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, pregnancy, religion, national origin, age as defined by law, or veteran or disability status, shall have equal opportunity in the education, employment or services of Clark University. This policy applies to the entire Clark community and is designed to comply with both the spirit and letter of governing state and federal laws. It is expected that faculty, staff, students and others who act on behalf of Clark University will effectuate this policy. View Full Policy Inclement Weather Policy As a primarily residential campus with students who continue to need services irrespective of the weather, Clark University rarely closes. View Full Policy Independent Contractor vs. Employee Policy and Training Under Massachusetts and federal law, the University is required to meet a number of obligations with respect to the treatment of employees, including wage and hour requirements, payroll tax withholding, and provision of workers compensation and unemployment benefits. When the University is contracting with a third-party entity (e.g., managed services provider, temp agency, IT staffing firm) to obtain personnel who are classified by those firms as employees or contractors to perform services. All University departments must comply with this Policy. View Full Policy and Guidelines Independent Contractor Questionnaire Independent Contractor Services Contract Minors on Campus Policy With a few updates, this policy now includes Vehicle Requirements, Qualifications of Driver(s) and the use of Swimming Pools for all camp programs. It also now includes several Appendixes referencing standardized forms that should be utilized when engaging with minors for different occasions. View Full Policy Nepotism Policy Individuals will not normally be employed by the University or transferred to a department where they will be subject to close supervision by another employee with whom they have a close personal relationship, or by a member of their family or household. Employees are expected to inform the Chief Human Resources Officer of these relationships. All cases involving the potential hiring or transfer of partners or relatives must be reviewed and approved by the Chief Human Resources Officer. Permanent Residency Sponsorship Guidelines (Green Card) The University will sponsor certain positions for permanent residency. If a department is interested in pursuing permanent residency for a faculty or administrator, we request that you initially contact the Office of Human Resources/Affirmative Action. The HR/AA office will confer with the International Student and Scholars Office to determine if the position held by the faculty or administrator is likely to qualify for University sponsorship. If so, the International Student and Scholars Office will begin the permanent residency process and serve as Clark’s liaison to the immigration attorney the University uses for these applications. No other attorneys will be allowed to process permanent residency applications on behalf of the University. If you have any questions about this policy please contact the International Student and Scholars Office or Human Resources/Affirmative Action. Personnel Grievance Policy and Procedures Clark encourages employees and managers to resolve any employment-related disputes on an informal basis. Clark recognizes that not all disputes can be resolved informally and has established the procedures set forth below to deal with some of those issues. No employee will be retaliated against because they sought resolution of a problem through the grievance procedures. View Full Policy Phased Retirement for Faculty Guidelines Summary Plan Description A. Introduction The following description is of a phased retirement plan for regular faculty of Clark University. The faculty member will enter into an agreement with the University to retire at a specific date in the future, and to reduce overall workload during the phased period of one semester to three years. The specific terms of an agreement will be arranged between the individual faculty member and the Provost, to the mutual agreement of both parties. It is anticipated that specific agreements for individuals will differ. B. Establishment of the Plan This Plan Summary Description sets forth the provisions of the University’s Phased Retirement Plan for faculty, established by Clark University as of September 1991. Funding for this plan is provided from the University’s general operating funds. C. Eligibility Participants must be tenured faculty with ten years of service at Clark University who have attained age 59. A year of service is defined as two semesters of full- time employment, including semesters of sabbatical leave and leave for pregnancy, but excluding other leaves of absence. D. Salary Clark will continue to track the nominal salary of a faculty member in phased retirement as what his or her salary would be as a full-time faculty member. All salary increases will be added to this nominal salary following the same decisions that apply to all full-time faculty members. The actual salary while on phased retirement will be less, depending on the level of work negotiated for the period on phased retirement. E. Work Responsibilities During a period of phased retirement, work responsibilities will be reduced by an amount negotiated between the faculty member and the Provost. Core teaching responsibilities will be negotiated along the following lines. For a faculty member whose normal full-time teaching load is four courses per year, the typical phased retirement arrangement will be two courses per year (potentially both in a single semester, but this needs to be part of the negotiation) for which the faculty member normally will receive 60% of his or her nominal full-time salary. This typical arrangement can be modified up or down in responsibilities in a linear way. Thus, 1 course per year normally would be compensated at 30% of the nominal full-time salary, while three courses per year normally would be compensated at 90% of the nominal full-time salary. Normally, one would expect the level of effort expected for service and research to track that expected for teaching. For a faculty member with a different standard full-time teaching load (e.g., a lecturer teaching six courses per year) the relationship between work expectations and pay should be similarly calculated, using the “8-unit” analysis of full-time faculty work (four units each semester; teaching one course is one unit). Thus, for a lecturer in phased retirement doing 50% work for 60% pay, we would expect three courses per year (50% of the full-time load) with commensurate reductions in service expectations. Similar linear extrapolations would provide for other possible alternatives, e.g., a lecturer in phased retirement teaching two courses per year — 33% work — normally would receive 40% of full-time pay. F. Benefits Faculty will be eligible for full benefits except sabbatical leave, life, and long-term disability insurance. The University’s contribution to TIAA/CREF and Social Security shall be based on actual salary paid. The University’s contribution to the faculty member’s health insurance plan will be equal to that for full-time faculty. However, for any full-time faculty member, phased or not, if an individual is restricted by the health insurance carrier from continuing enrollment in their current health insurance plan, the University will allow its regular contribution toward another plan (e.g. the faculty member does not live in the carrier’s service area). Continued eligibility for any health insurance plan is subject to policies and practices of the carrier. G. Application for Participation An eligible faculty member must apply to the Provost for participation in the phased retirement plan. The terms of each phased retirement agreement are subject to the approval of the Board of Trustees of Clark University. H. Plan Administration The Director of Human Resources at Clark University, (508) 793-7294, is the Administrator of this plan and is responsible for performing the duties required for the operation of the plan. The Administrator may designate in writing other persons to carry out duties under the plan. I. Plan Year The plan year is September 1 through August 31 of each year. Records for each participant are maintained on a calendar year basis. J. Requests for Information Requests for information and questions concerning eligibility, participation, or other aspects of the operation of the plan should be in writing and directed to the Administrator of this plan. K. Amendment and Termination While it is expected that this plan will continue, the University reserves the right to modify or discontinue the plan at any time. The University may also delegate any of its powers and duties with respect to the plan, or amendments, to one or more officers or other employees of the University. Any such delegation shall be set forth in writing. L. Statements of ERISA Rights Participants in the Phased Retirement Plan are entitled to certain rights and protections under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). ERISA provides that all plan participants shall be entitled to: Examine, without charge, at the Administrator’s office, all plan documents, including all plan documents filed with the U.S. Department of Labor such as annual reports and plan descriptions. Obtain copies of all plan documents upon written request to the Plan Administrator. The Administrator may make a reasonable charge for the copies. Receive a summary of the plan’s annual ERISA report to the Internal Revenue Service. The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each participant with a copy of this summary annual report. ERISA sets forth the duties of the people who are responsible for the operation of the Phased Retirement Plan. The people who operate this plan have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of the plan participants. No one including the University, may discharge or otherwise discriminate against participants in any way to prevent them from obtaining benefits to which they are entitled. Political Activity Guidelines Clark University is committed to active citizenship and, as a result, encourages faculty, staff and students to exercise their right to participate as individuals in the political process, whether they are running for office, reaching out to their elected officials, or expressing their views in public or private forums. At the same time, no member of the university community should feel any institutional pressure to support a particular candidate or position. View Full Policy Protests and Demonstrations Policy The right to freedom of expression at Clark includes the right to acts of peaceful dissent, nonviolent protests, and orderly demonstrations including picketing and the distribution of leaflets. View Full Policy Here Remote Access Policy The purpose of this policy is to state the requirements for remote access to computing resources hosted at Clark University using Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology. View Full Policy Remote Work and Telecommuting Policy Clark University may provide or approve alternative work arrangements for positions that are deemed fully remote or to accommodate flexible schedules for employees through a combination of on-campus and remote presence. View Full Policy Retirement Party Guidelines It is right and fitting that we have events to mark the retirement and/or departure from Clark of our friends and colleagues View Full Policy Sick Leave Donation Policy This policy is intended to be sensitive to the fact that employees may have extended conditions or re-occurring serious illnesses that may leave them without adequate sick leave. Employees may be allowed to donate a portion of their sick time to a fellow worker using the following guidelines: • The recipient of donated sick leave may receive a maximum total of 40 days per fiscal year from fellow employees, and must meet the following eligibility requirements: The recipient must: a) have an extended illness or condition, which requires an absence of more than five workdays. The Donor of sick leave must have a minimum of 20 days of earned sick time remaining for their own use after the donation to fellow employee(s). • All requests for sick leave donations must be sent in writing to the Chief Human Resource Officer or their designee for approval. Smoking Policy Clark University is a smoke-free campus. As of August 18, 2020, smoking of any kind, including any electronic nicotine-delivery system or smoking device, is prohibited for the entire campus community in or within close proximity to all facilities, Clark-owned or -leased properties, and areas occupied or controlled by the University. Read the full policy for smoking cessation resources. Read Full Policy Solicitation Policy Solicitation and/or distribution of materials regarding non-University sponsored programs or activities is prohibited if the solicitation results in disruption of, or interference with, the University’s educational or administrative activities. Employees may not use their positions, or the University’s facilities, letterhead, campus mail, email, or other resources for political or other purposes that are not a part of the University’s programs or functions. Staff Parental Leave Policy Regular full and part-time staff eligible for Family Medical Leave (FMLA), defined as having worked at Clark University for at least one year and/or a minimum of 1,250 hours during the previous 12 months, will be eligible to apply for up to eight weeks of paid parental leave. View Full Policy Protocol/Guidelines Standard Work Hours for Staff in Non-Exempt Positions Clark University’s guidelines state that full-time staff holding 35 hour/week non-exempt positions are expected to work Monday through Friday, either 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. or 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and for those working 37½ hour positions, the standard work day is 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. In both situations, the workday includes a one-hour unpaid lunch. Clark values the contributions of its employees and believes individuals should take advantage of this time to reenergize. Foregoing your lunch break on a regular basis is not an option. These standard hours have been defined to provide continuity and uniformity of office coverage across the university in both academic and administrative departments and afford faculty, staff and students the ability to conduct business throughout the workday. Employees in non-exempt positions are required by law to complete time sheets reflecting actual hours worked including the one-hour unpaid lunch beak. Time sheets are due in the Payroll office by 10 a.m. on Monday following the pay period, and should not be submitted prior to completing your work week. Time sheets are considered legal documents and the employee’s and supervisor’s signatures should reflect the accuracy and validity of the hours recorded. While the University recognizes the need for occasional flexibility in work schedules, if a supervisor believes that regular deviations from these standard work schedules would benefit the department and the University, they should receive approval from their respective vice president in consultation with the director of Human Resources. Remote Work and Telecommuting Policy and Form Clark University may provide alternative work arrangements in order to help employees balance work and personal commitments, or to enhance employees’ job performance and productivity, if: Departmental efficiency and service are not adversely affected; Regular office hours to meet departmental needs are not curtailed; and Undue burdens are not placed on other employees or supervisors. Alternative work arrangements may include modifications to work schedule, work location, and other arrangements that differ from the University’s and department’s usual standards and practices. Decisions about whether to accept or approve a request for an alternative work arrangement rest solely within the leadership of each division, and each division may establish its own process for review and approval of alternative work arrangement requests. All remote arrangements when an employee is regularly working in a non-Clark workspace must receive prior review from the Office of Human Resources. View Full Policy Travel Policy Clark University’s travel policy is designed to provide uniform guidelines and procedures regarding travel, and the management of related expenditures, by faculty and staff on University business. The intent of this policy is that reimbursement be fair to faculty and staff and equitable across the University, while maintaining compliance with IRS regulations. View Full Policy Visa and Legal Permanent Residency Sponsorship Policy and Procedures Clark University values the expertise and talents of international scholars, international non-faculty employees and researchers and supports sponsorship of foreign nationals (FN) for both nonimmigrant and immigrant visas, as outlined in this policy. Visa sponsorships are based on the needs of the University and must qualify as a specialty occupation as defined by USCIS. The qualifying employee must have the appropriate educational and professional background. Visa Sponsorship Eligibility Questionnaire View Full Policy Visitors to Campus – Guidelines Because of the potential disruption of visitors (both children and adults) who do not have University-related business, we request that employees do not have extended visits with their children, family members, or other acquaintances while on the job. In addition, for health and safety reasons, pets cannot be accommodated on campus. Whistleblower Policy Relative to Financial Assets This policy governs the reporting and investigation of allegations of suspected illegal or improper activities concerning the financial assets of the University, and the protection of whistleblowers from retaliation. It describes the procedures for investigating known or suspected illegal or improper activities and addressing complaints of retaliation for raising such issues. View Full Policy Workplace Principles Clark University believes that all employees are entitled to a safe workplace free from harassment, discrimination, and intimidation. The University holds dear its belief in free association, free speech, fairness in all dealings, and maintaining the dignity and respect of all who work here. The University has always been receptive to a diversity of views. The University is committed to the following fundamental employment and labor principles: Equal Opportunity — Clark University is firmly committed to the practice of equal employment opportunity. The University will administer its personnel policies and conduct its employment practices in a manner that treats each employee and applicants for employment and advancement on the basis of merit, experience, and other work-related criteria without regard to race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, sexual orientation, disability, or any other protected class under relevant state and federal laws. The University is further committed to the practice of affirmative action in accordance with the law to assure the most representative applicant pool and workforce. Clark strives to increase the presence and participation of under-represented groups by its aggressive recruitment procedures to attract and hire the best-qualified applicants, and values diversity among its faculty, staff and students. Freedom of Association/Right to Organize — The University recognizes and respects the right of workers to choose whether or not to be represented through collective bargaining. The University will abide by the terms of the National Labor Relation Act with regard to recognizing a union chosen by Clark employees.

Holiday Calendar Summer Hours Open Enrollment Work/Life Resources Policies Documents and Forms Performance Management Contact Us Career Opportunities Benefits Holiday Calendar Summer Hours Open Enrollment Work/Life Resources Policies Documents and Forms Performance Management Contact Us Performance Management Home Performance Management Purpose The annual performance review process sets the foundation aligning the individual’s efforts with the university’s goals for the coming year and is reliant on the level of engagement of both the supervisor and employee. By linking individual employee work efforts with the institution’s mission and objectives, the employee understands how their job contributes to the overall success of department and the University. By focusing attention on setting clear performance expectations it helps the employee know what needs to be done to be successful on the job. Through regular check-in discussions, which include status updates, coaching, and feedback, it promotes flexibility, allowing the supervisor and the employee to identify problems early and change the course of a project or work assignment. This process is an opportunity for employees to partner with their supervisors to establish goals and manage performance through frequent and ongoing review and feedback. The communication process includes clarifying expectations, setting objectives, identifying goals, providing feedback, and reviewing results. When done well, the performance review process results in both parties having a(n): Shared set of expectations for the year. Clear understanding of performance and progress toward goals throughout the year. Opportunity to strengthen their working relationship through regular discussions. Ability to directly impact the success of the department and Institution. Commitment to focus on the personal and career development of the employee. Starting this year, we are pleased to announce the introduction of a new initiative: the 360 feedback process. Supervisors will have the opportunity to request performance feedback from colleagues of their employees who regularly interact with them as part of their job responsibilities. This addition aims to provide a more comprehensive and insightful perspective on each individual’s performance within their respective teams. To facilitate this process, supervisors are encouraged to solicit recommendations from their colleagues before formally requesting feedback. This proactive step ensures a focused approach and guarantees that the feedback collected is both constructive and relevant. A dedicated 360 feedback form has been created to streamline the process and ensure consistency in the feedback collected. This form will serve as a guiding tool for respondents, helping them provide detailed and actionable feedback. At Clark all employees are expected to exhibit the core values of the institution that are imbedded in the University’s mission and Administrative and Staff Compact. For Employees Employees are strongly encouraged to prepare and submit a self-assessment for the prior year in advance of their formal performance review meeting with their supervisor. The intent of the self-assessment form is for employees to provide their supervisor with a reflective assessment of their performance over the past year that highlights accomplishments and strengths; recognizes areas of growth and acknowledges challenges; and, if applicable, identifies goals for the next year. This will allow supervisors to be better prepared for the in-person meetings and better able to integrate an employee’s achievements, challenges, and goals into the final performance review. Additionally, employees with a regular hybrid or remote modality are required to annually review the Remote Work and Telecommuting Policy and, submit the Alternative Work Arrangement Agreement Remote, Telecommuting and/or Flextime Request form to their supervisor for approval. For Supervisors The role of the supervisor is to set expectations, gather data, and provide ongoing feedback to their employees to assist them in utilizing their skills, expertise and ideas in a way that produces results. Supervisors are required to meet with and prepare a written performance review for all regular full- and part-time employees hired before January 1, 2024. Supervisors should refer to the Top Tips for Conducting Successful Performance Evaluations, the Administrative and Staff Compact, and LinkedIn Learning prior to completing performance reviews for employees. Resources LinkedIn Learning is an on-demand video platform that provides resources to members of the campus community with free access to video tutorials on a variety of custom learning content. Employees can access LinkedIn Learning through the ClarkYOU portal. Please log into your LinkedIn account to access the links below. Supervisors and employees are encouraged to utilize LinkedIn Learning as a resource to: Conduct a successful performance review How to write an effective performance review How to put people at the center of a performance reviews The manager’s role in conducting performance reviews Write a self-assessment How do you use your self assessment as a learning opportunity and a motivation tool?
