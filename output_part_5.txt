All tuition and fees Explanation of fees Estimate your cost Types of financial aid A college education is a significant investment in your future, and we strive to make a Clark education accessible to students from all financial backgrounds. Over 95% of students receive some form of aid from Clark, either merit-based, need-based or both. Merit-based financial aid Merit-based financial aid or scholarships are based on your achievements, academic performance, and personal qualities. Some scholarships come from foundations, non-profits, governments, companies, and, of course, colleges and universities. Clark offers several different merit- and achievement-based scholarships. All applicants are automatically considered for these scholarships alongside your application to Clark. Clark merit scholarships Merit scholarships are based on your academic performance and potential, accomplishments and talents, and personal qualities you bring to Clark. You are automatically considered for Clark’s merit scholarships; there is no need for a separate application. Merit scholarship decisions are made without consideration of financial need. Presidential Scholarship The Presidential Scholarship is a highly esteemed scholarship awarded to approximately five exceptional students annually. It recognizes individuals who stand out due to their outstanding academic achievements and leadership potential, placing them among the top applicants to Clark. Private scholarships You may be eligible for additional scholarships offered by local, statewide, and national organizations. First year scholarships Need-based financial aid Need-based financial aid is offered to a student based on their family’s financial circumstances. Need-based aid can come in the form of institutional or government grants, which do not need to be repaid, or federal loans. Students must reapply for need-based aid annually. Apply for need-based aid early so that if you’re admitted to Clark, we can provide both your admission decision and financial aid offer at the same time. FAFSA US citizens, permanent residents, and eligible non-citizens submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Clark’s FAFSA code is 002139, you’ll need that number. Complete your FAFSA CSS Profile All students including domestic and international students complete the CSS Profile Application. Clark’s CSS Profile code is 3279. The Non-Custodial Parent Profile is not required. Complete your CSS Profile Student Employment All students can work at Clark, either on campus or in the local community. You can find a job that matches your interests and helps you meet your career goals. If you qualify for Federal Work-Study, it will be included in your financial aid offer letter. Additionally, Clark University funds many jobs on campus and in the local Worcester community for students. If you are an applicant for the Fall 2025 semester and attend high school in California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Oregon, Texas, or Washington, you may qualify for our regional incentive grant. Grant and scholarships Office of Financial Assistance Additional information International Students Transfer Students Financial aid deadlines Apply for financial aid early: it’s a good idea to apply for financial aid right after you apply for admission.

Connect with Clark Request Information Find Your Admissions Counselor Interviews Information for School Counselors Regional Incentive Grant Undergraduate Admission Cost and Financial Aid Regional Incentive Grant Going to college in Massachusetts just got a little easier … Each year, Clark University designates a handful of states outside of New England as part of our regional incentive grants program. Admitted first-year students who attend high school in these states automatically receive this $5,000-per-year grant (renewable for a total of four years or $20,000). We know that moving across the country can be expensive, and the regional incentive grant alleviates some of that cost. For applicants applying to Clark for the Fall 2025 semester, the regional incentive grant states are California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Oregon, Texas, and Washington. About the Regional Incentive Grant The regional incentive grant does not require a separate application for you to receive it. You must be a first-time college student. The grant is based on where you attend high school, not necessarily where you live. This grant is renewable every year for up to four years of study. If you have any questions about the regional incentive grant, email your admissions counselor. Frequently Asked Questions How do I apply for the regional incentive grant? There is no separate application for this grant. If you are an admitted first-year student attending high school in one of these states, you will automatically receive the grant with your financial aid award. I’m not applying for financial aid. Do I qualify for the regional incentive grant? Yes. Students do not need to apply for need-based financial aid to qualify for this grant. I’m a transfer student. Do I qualify? No. The regional incentive grant is limited to first-time college students. I live in a regional incentive grant state, but I go to school in a different state. Will I receive the regional incentive grant? The regional incentive grant is awarded by where you attend high school. Students who live in a grant state but attend high school elsewhere are not eligible. Is the regional incentive grant renewable after my first year at Clark? Yes. You will receive the regional incentive grant each year for up to four years of study.

We encourage you to schedule an interview to help us understand you beyond your written application and to address any questions you may have about Clark.

Choose the method that suits you best, but please submit only one application. There is no fee for either option.

Schedule an interview Find your counselor Sign up for a campus visit According to our faculty Who thrives at Clark? “A curious student. A student who is willing to question their own beliefs, as well as everyone else’s.” “Interested in learning and growing, understands that learning and growing are as much their responsibility as ours.” “Not just someone who will study their books but someone who wants to engage in the community at large.” The waitlist What to do if you’re offered a spot on the waitlist If you are offered a spot on the waitlist, it’s important that you respond “yes” to remaining on the list. As space opens (including any financial aid we might be able to award), we look at the students who have actively said they are still interested in Clark by responding to our offer. We are typically able to offer a handful of students on the waitlist a spot in the first-year class every fall. If you are on the waitlist and very interested in Clark, please send your admissions counselor an email so they can make sure you are on the active “still interested” list. Frequently asked questions Is Clark test-optional? Yes. Clark University does not require students to submit either their SAT or ACT score as part of their application. Does your office have to receive my entire application by the deadline? Will you still review my application if some components are late? We strongly encourage you to submit all required materials by the deadline; however, we recognize it may not be possible in some cases. It’s most important that we receive your main application (either the Common App or the Coalition App with Scoir) by the deadline. Your other credentials may arrive after the deadline. You will be able to track your application materials in your applicant portal, and we’ll remind you by email of missing materials. If your application remains incomplete, it will be withdrawn, but only after we have attempted to notify you of what’s missing. It’s your responsibility to ensure your application is complete. Which application should I use, the Common Application or the Coalition Application with Scoir? You can apply using either application, and we do not have a preference which way you apply. Please submit only one application to Clark — you do not need to complete both! Neither application has a fee. How will I know when my application is complete? Once you’ve started your application, we’ll send you an email with information about how to log in to our applicant portal, and where you can check on the status of your materials, see what’s missing, and receive updates about your application. At peak periods around the deadlines, status updates on the portal are not immediate, so please allow for processing time. If you have questions about the status of your application, check your applicant portal, call 1-800-462-5275 or email our office. How will I be notified of Clark’s decision? All decisions are released through our applicant portal to your personal account, so you will be able to log in from anywhere to see your decision. You’ll receive credentials to sign in to this portal via email when we first receive your application materials. Note: We do not release admission decisions over the phone. Can I apply as a first-year student for spring admission? Yes, whether you are a U.S. citizens or an international student, you may apply as a first-year student for the spring semester. Follow the instructions for applying to Clark and submit your application by Nov. 1. Can I defer my enrollment if I am admitted via Regular Decision? Admitted students may postpone their enrollment for up to a year and must submit a request to defer in writing by May 1. A nonrefundable deposit (credited toward first-semester charges) is required. You cannot defer your enrollment at Clark if you intend to enroll in a degree-seeking program in the interim. Instead, you must reactivate your application and submit official transcripts for review. Can I receive Advanced Placement (AP) credit? Advanced Placement (AP) credit is defined as one unit of degree credit assigned for a score of 4 or 5 on a College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) AP exam taken after completion of an AP course and before the student formally matriculates. First-year students may receive credit for college work with grades of C or better completed prior to becoming a student at Clark University if that credit is in a content area deemed academically acceptable to Clark and is from an accredited college or university. First-year students may be awarded a maximum of eight units of credit (two semesters) for AP credit and/or credit from college courses taken while in high school.

Connect with Clark Request Information Find Your Admissions Counselor Interviews Information for School Counselors Early Decision Undergraduate Admission Apply Early Decision Applying Early Decision to Clark Each year, many Clark applicants choose to apply early decision. It’s one of three ways incoming first-year students can choose to submit their application, and we’re here to break down the benefits and tradeoffs of this early, binding admissions plan. Ultimately, when and how you apply to Clark is your choice, and we’re excited to read your application. Early decision FINANCIAL AID POLICY Clark guarantees to meet 100% of demonstrated need for all early decision I and II applicants. To qualify, we must receive your financial aid application materials by the admissions deadline. All accepted students will receive a preliminary financial aid award with their admission decision. What is Early Decision at Clark? Early Decision (ED) is a binding agreement you make with Clark. By applying ED, you are indicating that Clark is your top choice. If you are admitted, you are asked to withdraw applications from other schools and enroll at Clark early. To qualify for ED, your school counselor, a parent or guardian, and you must sign and submit the ED Agreement form along with your application. You must also apply by one of our two ED deadlines: Nov. 1 and Jan. 15. Benefits of Early Decision We meet 100% of demonstrated need for all ED applicants. Your application is read first, before our early action and regular decision applicants in each respective deadline. You show us you want to be here — and we value that interest. By applying ED, you are telling us that you want to be part of our community. That interest is important to your success at Clark, so we take it very seriously. You hear back from us sooner. Early Decision I applicants can expect to hear back before the end of December, and Early Decision II applicants can expect to hear back before the end of February. You know where you’re going to college. Because you hear back from Clark so quickly, and because you enroll right away, you have an answer to the question, “Where are you going to school next year?” You are done with the college search process. No need to stress about the May 1 Decision Day — you’re already a Clarkie! You have more time to meet your future peers. Join our admitted student social media groups, attend visit days, and start connecting with your future classmates, hall mates, and teammates in January and February. Tradeoffs of Early Decision You won’t be able to compare offers of admission from other colleges. If you are considering Clark strongly among several institutions but have not identified us as your top choice, we do not recommend applying early decision, instead, consider Early Action, which is non-binding. You can only pick one ED school. By signing the ED Agreement form, you are committing to apply to only to one school for early decision. This is why your school counselor co-signs the agreement — they keep you accountable to the agreement you are making with Clark. Common myths about early decision Myth #1 If I am accepted ED but can’t afford to attend, I’m trapped. When you apply to Clark, your need-based financial aid forms are due at the same time. This way, we can give you a preliminary financial aid award with your acceptance. If, after working with the Clark Office of Financial Assistance, you are still unable to afford a Clark education, you may ask to be released from the binding agreement. Plus, Clark meets 100 percent of demonstrated need for all ED applicants, so you will not be asked to pay for college outside of your means. Myth #2 If I apply ED, I’ll get a low scholarship award (or no scholarships at all) because I’m guaranteed to enroll. At Clark, we consider every student equally for merit-based scholarships. Period. We do not penalize students for showing interest in attending Clark through the ED plans, nor do we reserve funds for students who apply later. Myth #3 I shouldn’t apply ED if I am applying for financial aid. Concern about finances is one of the most cited reasons that students choose not to apply early decision. With Clark’s commitment to meeting 100 percent of demonstrated need for ED applicants, the ability to break the bind if you are financially unable to attend, and the receipt of a preliminary financial aid award upon acceptance, the early decision plan is financially generous, safe, and flexible.

What are the financial aid requirements for early decision and early action applicants? Early Decision: When applying Early Decision I/II, you must complete your application for financial aid, including the FASFA and the CSS Profile, by November 1 for Early Decision I and by January 15 for Early Decision II. Early estimates of need-based financial aid will be released at the time of your admissions decision; Clark also will let you know if you have received any merit aid. Early Action: If you are applying Early Action, and you are interested in being considered for need-based financial aid, you will need to fill out the FASFA and the CSS Profile by November 1. Can I defer my enrollment if I am admitted Early Decision I/II or Early Action? If you’d like to postpone your enrollment, you must submit a request in writing by May 1. Postponements may be up to a year. A nonrefundable deposit (credited toward first-semester charges) is required. If you enroll in another degree-seeking program in the interim, you may not defer enrollment but must instead reactivate your application and submit official transcripts for review. What if I am not admitted Early Decision I or Early Action? You may be deferred to the Regular Decision admission pool if the Admissions Committee expects that your application will improve during the extra time. In such cases, we welcome any additional information such as senior grades, additional standardized test scores, or recommendations.

Do you want to learn more? Then sign up for an interview. Interviews allow us to get to know you beyond the confines of your application, and you get to learn about Clark from a student or staff perspective. There are many ways to interview and all are equally good options. You can sign up to interview on campus, with an admissions counselor while we travel, or virtually from the comfort of your own home. All interviews are conducted by admissions counselors or a current Clark student. On-Campus interviews Virtual interviews Off-Campus interviews About the Interview Interviews last approximately 20 minutes and are strongly recommended for those applying to Clark. All spring semester juniors and seniors are eligible. Meet Us in Your Hometown As admissions counselors travel, you will receive an email if someone will be offering an interview in your area. While we love to meet you in your hometown, if you love Clark, feel free to sign up for a virtual interview earlier because we can’t promise that we’ll make it to every hometown in the world. Nervous about interviewing? Here are some hints: Wear what makes you feel comfortable. What you say matters more to us. Be ready to talk about things that make you feel proud, happy, and excited. We want to learn about what you love and what you are looking forward to learning. Come with a few questions.

Traveling to Clark ... By Air You have two main options for traveling via air: Boston Logan International Airport, then take a train or bus from Boston to Union Station, Worcester, and a taxi/ride-hailing service from there to Clark. Worcester Regional Airport: JetBlue, American, and Delta fly to several U.S. destinations. Take a taxi/ride-hailing service from the airport to Clark, about four miles. Other airports include Providence, R.I., Manchester, N.H., and Hartford, Conn., but getting to Clark from these locations is often more complicated than from the Boston or Worcester airports. Getting to Clark from Boston: The cheap but indirect route Take a train or bus to Union Station in downtown Worcester, where you will need to take a taxi or ride-hailing service to get to Clark. Getting to Clark from Boston: The direct but slightly more costly route Use a shared van/limousine service like Knights Limousine Service, to pick you up at Boston airport and bring you directly to campus. Many students use this option. Be sure to make reservations early and allow for travel time. The trip from Boston to Worcester can take more than an hour at peak travel times. This option is cheaper if you travel with a group. By Train Worcester’s Union Station is approximately three miles from campus. It’s serviced by Amtrak’s Lake Shore Limited and Regional Lines, and the MBTA Commuter Rail from Boston. The best way to get to Clark from Union Station is by taxi or ride-hailing service (information below).

Course offerings are published at the start of advising each semester. Select the semester below for course schedules, registration dates, and final exam periods. Additional information such as the Academic Calendar, Academic Catalog, and Web Registration Instructions are included within the Registrar’s Office website. Many classroom spaces are viewable online along with a list of their Software by navigating to the ITS webpage. Class Standing Current class level for undergraduate students is calculated by the number of units earned. 0-7.99 units completed = First Year class standing 8-15.99 units completed = Sophomore class standing 16-23.99 units completed = Junior class standing 24 or more units = Senior class standing Online registration priority dates for undergraduate students(Fall & Spring), however, are determined by the student’s anticipated class as of the next semester, which includes BOTH earned units and currently registered units. For example, if a student has 12 earned units (current sophomore class) and is registered for 4 units this semester (total of 16), then that student’s anticipated class for the next semester is junior. Thus, the student’s “class for registration purposes” is junior. Please refer to the Prepare for Registration tile in your web account to verify your class standing for registration purposes. NOTE: Undergraduate In-season NCAA athletes may be assigned to an earlier class for registration. Please contact the Athletics Department if you have any questions about your status &/or time block. Undergraduate students with approved registration accommodations may be assigned to the first day of registration, contact SAS if you have questions. Honors Experience Program students may also be able to register beginning the first day of registration, contact your Honors Advisor if you have questions. A student may be going into their third year however if they did not take 4 units each semester &/or withdrew/failed a course, then they would register with the Sophomores. Enrollment Status Enrollment statuses are used to determine financial aid eligibility, loan deferment, FICA exemption, health insurance, and so on. After each term begins, enrollment statuses are reported to the National Student Clearinghouse several times in the semester to ensure that loan agencies have accurate and up-to-date enrollment information for you, as is required by federal regulations. Registration enrollment statuses and criteria are defined as follows: Enrollment StatusUnit CriteriaFull-time3.00 and upThree-quarter time1.75 to 2.75Half-time1.50Less than half-time0.25-1.25 Questions pertaining to the above definitions as they relate to financial aid or loan deferment, please contact Financial Assistance.

However, certain information classified as “Directory Information” is available for public consumption unless the student specifically directs that it be withheld. Public Directory Information includes: student’s name, addresses (campus, home, email), telephone listings, photograph, major field of study, class year, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, enrollment status (e.g., undergraduate or graduate; full-time, half-time, part-time), degrees, honors, and awards received, and the most recent previous educational institution attended. To request that directory information be withheld, please contact the Registrar’s Office. FERPA affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. They are: The right to inspect and review the student’s education records within 45 days of the day the University receives a request for access. Students should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate official, written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The University official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes are inaccurate or misleading. Students may ask the University to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading. They should write the University official responsible for the record, clearly identifying the part of the record that they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student’s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure. One exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the University has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failure by Clark University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance OfficeU.S. Department of Education600 Independence Avenue, SWWashington, DC 20202-4605 How to edit your ferpa authorizations Federal and State Data Collection and Use As of Jan. 3, 2012, the U.S. Department of Education’s FERPA regulations expand the circumstances under which student education records and personally identifiable information (PII) contained in such records–including Social Security number, grades, or other private information–may be accessed without student consent. First, the U.S. Comptroller General, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or state and local education authorities (“Federal and State Authorities”) may allow access to records and PII without student consent to any third party designated by a Federal or State Authority to evaluate a federal- or state-supported education program. The evaluation may relate to any program that is “principally engaged in the provision of education,” such as early childhood education and job training, as well as any program that is administered by an education agency or institution. Second, Federal and State Authorities may allow access to education records and PII without student consent to researchers performing certain types of studies, in certain cases even when Authorities object to or do not request such research. Federal and State Authorities must obtain certain use-restriction and data security promises from the entities that they authorize to receive PII, but the Authorities need not maintain direct control over such entities. In addition, in connection with Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems, State Authorities may collect, compile, permanently retain, and share without student consent PII from education records, and they may track participation in education and other programs by linking such PII to other personal information obtained from other Federal or State data sources, including workforce development, unemployment insurance, child welfare, juvenile justice, military service, and migrant student records systems. FERPA Policy The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), better known as the Buckley Amendment, requires that institutions of higher education strictly protect the privacy rights of all students who are or have been in attendance. In practice, this means that information contained in the student’s educational record can be shared only with school officials who have a legitimate educational interest and a legitimate need to know such information to fulfill their professional responsibilities. For these purposes, “legitimate educational interest” shall mean an educationally related purpose that has a directly identifiable educational relationship to the student involved. School Officials For purposes of FERPA, school officials are those members of an institution who act in the student’s educational interest within the limitations of their “need to know.” The following people are defined as having a legitimate need for access to any educational record for students under their jurisdiction: the President and the Provost, the Dean of the College, the Dean of Graduate Studies, the Dean of Students, the Associate Dean of the College for Academic Advising, the Director of Academic Advancement, the Dean of the Graduate School of Management, and the Dean of School of Professional Studies. Where appropriate, these school officials may, at their discretion, choose to share such information with university faculty or staff on a need-to-know basis. Directory Information Directory information is general information contained in the educational record of a student that generally would not be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. Public directory information as defined by FERPA includes: student’s name, addresses (campus, home, email), telephone listings, photograph, major field of study, dates of attendance, class year, enrollment status (e.g., undergraduate or graduate; full-time, half-time, part-time), participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, degrees, honors and awards received, and most recent educational institution attended. School officials may, at their discretion, release directory information to third parties unless the student specifically directs that it be withheld. Registrar’s Office The Registrar’s Office is the keeper of all educational records and treats the student’s educational record with the utmost confidentiality. The University Registrar is responsible for all the educational records and will share non-directory information about individual students with other school officials only on a need-to-know basis. Faculty All official records created by Clark faculty in fulfilling their professional obligations (e.g., grades and comments on graded papers) are protected by FERPA. Informal records maintained by Clark faculty (e.g., notes about meetings with students) that are kept under the sole possession of the faculty member, that have not been created with the assistance of anyone else, and that are accessible only to a temporary substitute do not fall under FERPA’s umbrella. Nevertheless, such informal records should be shared with third parties only on a need-to-know basis. Faculty who serve as academic advisers will have access to their advisees’ academic records. They will also be notified of any change in an advisee’s academic status. Where appropriate, they will be informed of those actions of the College Board that relate to their advisees. All faculty will have access to a student’s class schedule for the purpose of overriding a registration restriction. Academic Advising Center The Associate Dean of the College for Academic Advising may share a student’s educational record with members of the staff of the Academic Advising Center when it is deemed appropriate for them to have such information in the execution of their duties. Student Affairs Staff The Dean of Students may share a student’s educational record with members of the Student Affairs staff when it is deemed appropriate for them to have such information in the execution of their duties. Admissions FERPA does not apply to the records of applicants for admission who are denied acceptance to Clark, nor does it apply to applicants who are accepted but choose not to attend Clark. Admitted students are covered by FERPA once they have enrolled. A student is considered enrolled on the first day of classes. Athletics The Associate Dean of the College for Academic Advising will share information about the academic status of student athletes with the Director of Athletics for the purposes of ensuring NCAA compliance. The Dean of Students may share judicial information with the Director of Athletics in support of the Athletic Code of Conduct. S/he may also share information of a serious nature about a student when it is relevant to that student’s status as an athlete. Other Persons Faculty serving on university committees where legitimate “need to know” exists may have access to educational records. Faculty members of registered honor societies may have access to student educational records for the sole purpose of determining eligibility for membership on the basis that they are acting in an official university capacity that is integral to the educational function of the university. In both cases, the legitimate educational interests of students and the university have been served. Official Agents Clark University may share certain personally identifiable information with official agents. An official agent of the university is a person or organization performing a business function or service on behalf of the institution (a function or service that the institution normally would perform itself). All official agents of Clark University have signed an agency agreement that stipulates that they will adhere to FERPA guidelines.

Advising and Registration What are the requirements for graduation? To graduate from Clark you will need to have a minimum of a 2.0 GPA, have declared and fulfilled the requirements of at least one major program, and have completed 32 units (classes) with at least 16 units completed at Clark.

These requirements include: Written Expression Formal Analysis Aesthetic Perspective Global Comparative Perspective Historical Perspective Language and Culture Perspective Scientific Perspective Values Perspective Diversity and Inclusion Perspective What is the timeline for registration? Dates for the posting of course schedules, the student advising period, and online registration are found on the Registrar Office web page. Access the Academic Calendar by clicking here. To be ready for registration, you must meet with your major advisor (academic advisor if you have yet to declare your major) and get their approval of your class list to release the registration hold. We recommend having 4-6 classes prepared prior to this meeting.

From the Check Your Registration Status screen, scroll to the bottom and click on View Holds. All holds must be released for you to be able to register at your appointed time. Here are the offices that review and can release each hold. Advising Hold – Primary Faculty Advisor Emergency Contact – Will be released once completed through CUWeb. Student Accounts Hold – Student Accounts Office Get Inclusive Modules – Office of Community Standards Health Forms – Health Services Department Taking a fifth course during the semester Students are eligible to request taking a fifth course during the semester if they are hoping to either catch up on units, apply it towards an accelerated program, or take a course for personal enrichment. Only Sophomores (8-15 units) with a 3.6 GPA or higher, or Juniors and Seniors (16 or more units) with a 3.0 GPA or higher, are eligible. Forms are reviewed once grades are submitted at the end of the semester. This review usually occurs in the first week of January for the Spring semester and the first week of June for the Fall semester. The deadline for fifth course request forms to be submitted to the Academic Advising Center is the last day of add/drop each semester. Please make sure to turn these in prior to the deadline, as this will provide time for the AAC staff to approve the forms and have the Registrar’s Office process the submission so you can register for the 5th class before add/drop ends. Download Fifth Course Request Form Download Fifth Course Request Fillable Form Taking a course across the HECCMA Consortium All full-time students, except first-year students and first semester transfer students, may enroll in one course per semester (fall or spring) at any of the following schools: Anna Maria College Assumption College Becker College College of the Holy Cross Massachusetts College of Pharmacy Nichols College Quinsigamond Community College Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine University of Massachusetts Worcester Worcester Polytechnic Institute Worcester State College You must get the signature of the comparable department chairperson here at Clark to ensure that this course is not a duplication of a course available at Clark and is acceptable for credit. Staff in the Academic Advising Center give approval of courses for which there is no related department at Clark.

Submit Search Query For Students For Advisors and Faculty Major Planning Contact Us Info For Academic Advising Handbook For Students For Advisors and Faculty Major Planning Contact Us For Advisors and Faculty Home For Advisors and Faculty What is the Role of a Faculty Advisor? Establish a caring working relationship with your advisees. Remember that academic advising is an extension of your teaching that continues throughout the year. Scheduling classes is only one small aspect of advising. Help students to clarify their goals. Initiating a discussion with your advisees about their goals will enable you to provide them with more meaningful advice as they make their academic plans. Encourage students to begin planning for their future career. Planning for one’s career is not something a student should begin in the senior year. It is a process that can start in their first semester on campus. Urge students to access the opportunities offered by advisors in the Career Connections Center. Relate interest and abilities to plans. While it is important to encourage your advisees to take on challenges, it is also important that their decisions have some basis in reality. Sometimes a student’s interest in a subject may far exceed their ability. Assist advisees in exploring and selecting majors. Review departmental requirements with students as they explore potential academic directions. You’ll find program details for each major, minor, and concentration in the academic catalog. Help students select appropriate courses for their academic plans Courses that meet the requirements for Clark Core are an excellent way to expose students to a variety of academic disciplines. Encouraging students to meet as many of these requirements as they can in the first two years will provide them with a strong foundation and an introduction to the breadth of academic study. Monitor students’ academic progress. Advisors play a crucial role in celebrating students’ strong academic performance, as well as identifying steps to take when academic improvement is needed. Faculty will be able to review advisees’ academic performance through the mid-semester feedback survey and end of semester grades and utilize these insights to provide appropriate next steps. Encourage students to get involved in campus activities. Students involved in co- and extra-curricular activities are more likely to establish a sense of connectedness to Clark and are, therefore, more likely to be engaged across Clark through and beyond graduation. Refer students to campus resources when appropriate. Recognize when an advisee needs the assistance of another professional on campus. Facilitating the connection between your advisee and an appropriate campus resource is an important role that advisors can play. Recognize that you are not alone in this endeavor. You have the support of the DOC and DSS staff who add to the advising experience; professional expertise in the areas of academic advising, student accessibility, counseling, academic coaching, First Year Success Advising, study abroad, peer tutoring, and writing assistance. Registration Process Dates for the posting of course schedules, the student advising period, and online registration are found on the Registrar’s Office web page. Access the Academic Calendar by clicking here. To be ready for registration, students must meet with their major or academic advisor and get their approval of the student’s intended class list to release the registration hold. Faculty advisors should reach out to their cohorts a few weeks prior to registration week to communicate how they want students to schedule these 1-1 meetings. Please make sure to inform Academic Advising and your department chair should you plan to take a leave of absence or sabbatical so that your advisees can be reassigned to another advisor for those semesters.

IMPORTANT RESOURCES University Police1-508-793-7575 or via any emergency phone on campus. Health Services1-508-793-7467 Center for Counseling and Personal Growth1-508-793-7678 Serious Crime/Violence/Active Shooter It is impossible to predict the actions and specific circumstances of every crime or violent act. The following procedures may help lessen the potential for injury: If you observe a criminal act or suspicious person, from a campus phone dial 7575. Otherwise, dial 1-508-793-7575. Be mindful of your personal safety. Remember details of incident: description of clothing, physical characteristics, accent, tattoos, more than one suspect, etc. Do not sound the fire alarm. Exit the area immediately and report to University or local police. Use your instincts. In a hostage situation, stay calm, keep everyone together and stay hidden. If you are unable to hide, play dead if other victims are around you. If captured, obey all commands. Encourage conversation to develop rapport. Use comfortable eye contact. Evaluate intruder’s body language to determine your next action(s). If you are in the vicinity of an active shooter situation, barricade doors and place any available solid material between you and the shooter. Stay in place if it is safe to do so. Wait for police to clear and evacuate the area. Remain calm and quiet. Silence cell phones. Use common sense not to expose yourself or others to harm. If you are outdoors, seek shelter away from the area that is involved if it is safe to do so. Bomb Threats/Suspicious Objects If you observe a suspicious object or potential bomb on campus, do not handle the object. Call University Police at extension 7575 immediately. If you receive a bomb threat telephone call: Have someone nearby contact University Police at extension 7575 or 1-508-793-7575. Keep caller on line as long as possible. Ask caller: When will the bomb will go off? Where is the bomb? Which building? What kind of bomb? Description of it Why did you place the bomb? Note time of call and approximate age and: Speech pattern (accents) Emotional state of caller Background noise If you find a suspicious object: Don’t touch the object. Don’t activate the building alarm. Don’t open drawers or cabinets. Don’t turn on/off electrical devices or switches (light switches, cell phones, radios, or any other kind of electronic device). Don’t use elevators. Be aware of secondary devices Chemical Exposure/Hazardous Spills Hazardous spills and hazardous chemical exposure can cause damage to individuals, the environment, critical infrastructure, and property. The spill, release, or exposure incident can be an unplanned sudden or a non-sudden release. Potential hazard spills or exposure can include Chemical, Biological (Human Waste or Etiological Agent), Radiological, Thermal, and Asphyxiation Hazards. Faculty or staff in control of the area/classroom/laboratory should evacuate the affected area immediately. If individuals are exposed or contaminated they should remain in the vicinity but away from danger for first aid and decontamination mitigation by a hazardous materials research specialist. The area/classroom/laboratory hazard zone should be isolated and contained from further exposure or additional contamination spread. Wait for direction from University Officials and First Responders (Certified and trained emergency personnel). When reporting a chemical exposure or hazardous spill be specific about the identification of the hazardous material by severity of the hazard using three principal categories (Health, Flammability, and Instability) and the exact location of the chemical exposure/hazardous spill. All chemical exposures/hazardous spills/non-hazardous spills should be immediately reported to the University Police. University Police have access to main shut off valves. Call extension 7575 (1-508-793-7575) so that we can take the necessary actions. Fire Before faced with a fire, familiarize yourself with fire extinguisher locations, exits, and building fire alarms / pull stations. Smoke is the greatest danger in a fire. As you evacuate, or if you are trapped, always stay near the floor where the air is less toxic. Do not panic. Activate the closest building fire alarm for emergency response. When the building fire alarm is sounded, always assume an emergency exists, EXIT the building immediately, UNLESS prior to the alarm gunshots have been heard or a Clark Alert has been received advising you to stay in place. Use common sense. If a fire appears controllable, discharge a fire extinguisher toward the base of the flame. As you exit the building, notice any individuals not responding to the emergency alarm and call out to them to leave the building. Assist persons with disabilities to exit. Close but do not lock doors to confine fire. Do not use elevators. Use alternate evacuation routes if the normal route is blocked. Feel closed doors from top to bottom, in the evacuation route, IF COLD open the door, IF HOT, DO NOT OPEN the door and use an alternative evacuation route. (Hot doors may be an indication of fire on the other side of the door). Avoid smoke filled areas. If the room or evacuation route is filling with smoke, crouch down as you exit. Smoke rises, pushing available air to the floor. Should your clothing catch on fire-STOP DROP and ROLL to smother flame. If trapped during a fire: Shout at regular intervals to alert emergency crews of your location. Use your cell phone to alert University Police of your location (1-508-793-7575) Find a window and place an article of clothing outside of it and or use the back of an Emergency Guide book (HELP) to place in outside windows as a marker for rescue crews. Wait for the all-clear announcement from University officials before reentry of the building / area. Medical Emergency University Police is equipped with automatic external defibrillators and police officers are certified as first responders. To notify police, call on-campus extension 7575 or, via cell phone or off-campus phone, dial 1-508-793-7575. When assisting, make sure there are no safety concerns for you. Use protective gloves and barrier devices to protect yourself from bodily fluids when available. If person is vomiting with no trauma and is unable to move, roll the person on side, and lay head on arm. Tilt head up to open airway. If injured, keep person on back. If no neck/ spinal injury is suspected, elevate legs 6 to 12 inches. Cover with blanket/coat to keep body warm. Don’t move person with neck/spinal injury unless factors will cause more harm (i.e. fire). Elevate bleeding extremities; maintain direct pressure; control bleeding with a thick cloth. If the person is not breathing, has no pulse and you are trained in CPR, begin immediately. Ask a bystander to call extension 7575 or 1-508-793-7575 Seizures: clear area around the person; don’t restrain or place anything in person’s mouth. Weather/Natural Disasters Fear at the time of a disaster may breed panic. Panic can account for more injuries than the disaster itself. Therefore, calming personnel and students and preventing panic are critical. Familiarize yourself with assembly area locations listed in this guide prior to any emergency. You are expected to meet at these locations. Always follow the direction of emergency response personnel. Earthquakes Stay away from windows or bookcases. Identify safe places such as: In a doorway Under sturdy furniture Against an inside wall Protect yourself at all times and be prepared for aftershocks. Severe Storms Don’t use the telephone and plumbing fixtures. Wind, rain and lightening can cause dangerous situations. Avoid water, metal objects, open spaces and electrical appliances during lightening storms. Hurricanes/Tornadoes Use the basement level of all campus buildings as a designated tornado shelter. If no basement, go to a small interior room with no windows, such as halls, closets, stairwells. Sexual Offense Procedures to Follow When a Sexual Offense Occurs For a person subjected to a sexual offense, especially an act of sexual assault, there can be time-sensitive decisions to make about sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy, and collecting physical evidence in the event of prosecution. Protect Yourself: Find a safe place as soon as possible. Contact Someone You Trust: You may wish to ask a trusted friend or family member to assist and support you. Get Medical Attention:Seek medical attention immediately. Injuries and exposure to disease may not be immediately apparent. A medical examination can provide necessary treatment and collect important evidence. It is recommended that a physical exam be conducted within 72 hours of the incident in order to adequately preserve evidence. Survivors of a sexual assault are encouraged to go to the UMass Memorial Hospital Emergency Department (119 Belmont Street, Worcester, MA 01605), before washing yourself or your clothing. A Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (a specially trained nurse) at UMass Memorial Hospital is on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week (call the Emergency Department at 508-334-6481, if you first want to speak to the nurse). A representative from the University and/or a support person can also accompany you to the hospital and University Police can provide transportation if necessary. If you go to the hospital, local police will be called, but you are not obligated to talk to the police or to prosecute. The exam will help to keep that option open for you, should you decide later to exercise it. The hospital staff will collect evidence, check for injuries, and address the possibility of exposure to sexually transmitted infections. If you have changed clothing since the assault, bring the clothing you had on at the time of the assault with you to the hospital in a clean, sanitary container such as a clean paper grocery bag or wrapped in a clean sheet (plastic containers do not breathe, and may render evidence useless). If you have not changed clothes, bring a change of clothes with you to the hospital, if possible, as they will likely keep the clothes you are wearing as evidence. Try to Preserve Physical Evidence: It is important to preserve all physical evidence following an act of sexual violence. Physical evidence may be necessary in the event criminal prosecution is pursued. If possible, a victim should not to wash, eat, drink, shower, use the bathroom, or change clothes. If clothes are changed, all clothes that were worn at the time of the incident should not be cleaned and should be placed into a clean paper bag. Do not disturb the crime scene. Leave all sheets, towels, etc. that may bear evidence for the police to collect. Health and Support Services: Various health and support services are available on-campus and off-campus for students involved in incidences of sexual violence or the Title IX process. Please also see How to Help a Friend page for tips on how to support your friends, as well as, the reporting options available Report the Incident: Clark strongly encourages victims of sexual offense to discuss what happened so they can get the support they need, and so the University can respond appropriately to assist the victim and help ensure the safety of other members of the Clark community. Please see Clark’s Sexual Offense Policy for reporting options. Assembly Area The default location for any evacuation on campus is the Kneller Athletic Center. If an alternate location is established due to the nature of the situation, you will be redirected by a Clark official. IMPORTANT RESOURCES 1-508-793-7575 or via any emergency phone on campus. Health Services1-508-793-7467 Center for Counseling and Personal Growth1-508-793-7678 The documents above establish guidelines for Clark University personnel and departments about how to respond to major emergencies (such as violent crime, natural disasters, and medical crises) on the Clark University campus. You are advised to review these documents BEFORE an emergency occurs and are expected to understand procedures for which you are responsible. Hard copies of the Emergency Guide (a subset of the first document) will be distributed to each residence hall room, classroom, and office on campus. Additionally, it is the responsibility of each department and office to develop its own localized emergency plan relevant to the building in which it is located, using the Emergency Response Plan as a guide. Since the mission of the Clark University Emergency Response Plan is to enable the University to respond to an emergency situation in a safe, effective, and timely manner, this and associated department plans must be dynamic in nature and will be revised as required to reflect changing needs. Faculty, staff, and students must take personal responsibility for their individual safety in any emergency situation. Use the guides to help you think about how you would react to the various situations described. If an emergency were to occur, your own planning will prove invaluable by preparing you to react to the event in a calm and safe manner. Become familiar with your surroundings, know the location of the emergency exits and emergency telephones. Think about your location and the primary and secondary exits available for your use in case you need to evacuate a building. Clark Alerts is an electronic message service that Clark will use as the primary notification system in emergency events. Register for Clark Alerts and keep your information updated. Additional information will be posted on this page as it becomes available. Questions should be directed to Lamara Burgess, (lamburgess@clarku.edu, 1-508-793-8875).

For example, in the event of a major storm, we might use Clark Alerts to send a message to the Parent/Family contact in advance of the storm to let them know about preparations being made and/or after the storm to update them on the storm’s impact on the campus. The”Parent/Family Cell Phone” or “Parent/Family Voice Only” fields are available to you for this purpose. Please note that Parent/Family contacts will not generally receive Clark ALERTS message that are sent while an emergency is taking place. If you provide additional contact information, we strongly suggest you notify that person that they are a contact for you in Clark ALERTS.

Submit Search Query Clark ALERTS Bias Incident Reporting Safety and Threat Assessment Team Sexual Offense Policies and Reporting Resources Contact Us Clark ALERTS Bias Incident Reporting Safety and Threat Assessment Team Sexual Offense Policies and Reporting Resources Contact Us Bias Incident Reporting Home Bias Incident Reporting Bias Incident Reporting Procedures Clark University values diversity, inclusion, and an environment free from discriminatory conduct. The University embraces diversity of all kinds and is committed to providing a safe, respectful, educational, and work environment that is free of harassment and intimidation for all members of the Clark community. Clark’s Bias Incident Response Protocol is designed to provide information about reporting bias incidents and/or hate crimes and to outline the procedures the University will follow in response to reported incident. Clark takes seriously all acts of bias and/or hate of which it becomes aware. To that end, the University will respond appropriately by supporting the target(s) of such acts. The response includes assessing reports; conducting an investigation; refer to appropriate department(s) that may initiate a conduct process; and advising the Clark community of the occurrence when appropriate. Bias Incident Report Process 2024-2025 Definitions Bias Incident Response Team The Bias Incident Response Team is a team of administrators and faculty who are committed to creating a proactive response to bias incidents. Clark’s Bias Incident Response Team includes the Dean of Students; Director for Residential Life and Housing; Director for Diversity and Inclusive Excellence; Director of Human Resources; Chief of University Police; and Dean of the College. Bias Incident Any conduct or communication motivated by hatred or prejudice that demeans, degrades, or harasses an individual or group based upon membership in a protected category as recognized by law or Clark University policy, including race, color, national or ethnic origin, ancestry, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, genetics, physical or mental disability, and veteran or other protected status. Examples include targeting a group or individual, in person or electronically, with hateful conduct that interferes with a person’s educational experience or employment, as well as acts of vandalism or graffiti. A bias incident may or may not involve violations of University policies or state or federal law. Discrimination Discrimination is an act or communication that unlawfully interferes with an individual’s or group’s ability to participate fully in the Clark University community on the basis of (1) age, (2) race, (3) color, (4) national origin, (5) religion, (6) sex, (7) sexual orientation, (8) gender identity and/or expression, (9) marital status, (10) disability, (11) veteran status, (12) pregnancy, (13) genetic information or other legally protected status. Hate Crimes Acts constituting hate crimes, as defined by Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 22C, Section 32, include “any criminal act coupled with overt actions motivated by bigotry and bias including, but not limited to, a threatened, attempted or completed overt act motivated at least in part by racial, religious, ethnic, handicap, gender or sexual orientation prejudice, or which otherwise deprives another person of his constitutional rights by threats, intimidation or coercion, or which seek to interfere with or disrupt a person’s exercise of constitutional rights through harassment or intimidation.” For purposes of this protocol, all hate crimes are considered a form of bias incident. Chapter 265 Crimes Against the Person – Section 39 states in relevant part that it is illegal to commit a crime against one’s person or property with the intent to intimidate such person because of such person’s race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, or disability. Target Person(s) Individuals or groups, who believe or perceive that they have been the victim of a bias incident and/or hate crime. Any individual or group can be targeted. Clark University Harassment and Discrimination Prevention Policy Clark University prohibits harassment/discrimination based on (but not limited to) age, race, color, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, and veteran status. This policy extends to all programs and activities, including admission, education, employment, and athletics. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the role of the Bias Incident Response Team (BIRT)? The Bias Incident Response Team is a team of administrators and faculty who are committed to creating a proactive response to bias incidents. Who are the members of the BIRT? While specific individuals may change, there will consistently be at least one representative from the Dean of the College (DOC), the Division of Student Success (DSS), Human Resources (HR), and University Police (UP). Based on the incident, the report will be triaged to the appropriate member(s) of the BIRT to act as the lead for response. Who should report a bias incident? Any member of the Clark community who witnesses, experiences, or has information regarding a bias incident should immediately report the incident. In the incident of a hate crime (see definition in section above), university police may be involved in accordance with Massachusetts general law. Why should I report? Reporting is important even if the offending party or parties cannot be identified. The BIRT utilizes the data received to inform policies throughout the Clark community. Each semester, the BIRT will assess and analyze the incidents reported in order to strategize on how to better serve the needs of bias and discrimination impacting the Clark community. Any trends that are evident could prompt recommendations on education, programming, and/or changes in university policies. What will I be asked to provide in the report? You will be asked to provide a detailed account of the incident. The following are often included: Date, time and location Name(s) or a detailed description of each person involved, including witnesses Description of what you observed and what was said, to the best of your recollection. This should include any specific language or terms that were used. Other pertinent information that may assist Clark University in responding to the incident. What is the BIRT process? How long will the process take? The Process: Alleged Incident Occurs Incident Reported Acknowledgement of Report Report Triaged for Response Incident Review and Fact Gathering Restorative Action Plan Developed Implementation of Restorative Action Plan Relevant Follow-up, Documentation and Case Closure Generally, the BIRT strives to find a resolution within ≈ 30 days after a report has been submitted. While you may not know the outcome, you will be notified once a case has been closed. Can I make an anonymous report? What about confidentiality? Those submitting a report do have the option to remain anonymous, or to report solely for informational purposes. Clark is committed to protecting the privacy of all individuals involved in a report of a bias incident. Every effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of individuals targeted and to maintain the confidentiality requested by the reporting party. The outcome of any reported incident will take into account the confidentiality of the involved parties. What are possible responses utilized by the BIRT to resolve an incident? In all instances where bias incidents are alleged, the totality of the circumstances will be evaluated. The BIRT will take into consideration the nature, severity, and impact on the Clark community, along with any legal obligations, among other things. Responses to an incident could include the following: Utilization of restorative process to rectify institutional, interpersonal, and/or intergroup conflict Providing education and resources to mitigate chances of reoccurence Facilitating a space for the parties involved to engage in a dialogue/conversation Recommendation of a policy change Will my report lead to a disciplinary response? The Bias Incident Response Team has no authority to discipline any student or employee. However, if during this process it is discovered that a university policy was violated or a law was broken, a bias incident report could indirectly result in further action being taken. Bias incidents that violate the University’s Student Code of Conduct will be referred to and addressed through the University’s student judicial process. Reports of bias incidents involving staff or faculty will be referred to Human Resources or Office of the Provost as appropriate. The University may refer to the criminal courts any bias incident that violates Massachusetts law. What happens if a report is determined not to be a bias incident? There are times when a bias incident report could be found not to have been a bias incident. Often, this occurs due to the inability to censor or punish people for comments that are protected speech. In these cases, the BIRT is open to providing resources and spaces to help facilitate any subsequent difficult conversations. bias incident reporting form Contact Information Emergency Management and Campus Assistance Of
