bout Scholarly & Creative Works Awards & Grants About Professor Aghil Alaee Khangha joined the Mathematics department at Clark University in fall 2020. Before joining Clark University, he was a Black Hole Initiative fellow at Harvard University (2019-2020); a postdoctoral fellow at the Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications at Harvard University (2018-2019); a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto (2017-2018); and a Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences postdoctoral fellow at the University of Alberta (2015-2017). He received his doctorate in mathematics, with distinction, from Memorial University in December 2015. Professor Alaee's research focuses on geometric analysis and mathematical relativity. He investigates conjectures in general relativity — such as existence, uniqueness, and stability — and the formation of black holes using geometric analysis, which lies at the intersection of developments in differential geometry, partial differential equations, and modern physics. He has proved several geometric inequalities involving total energy, quasi-local energy, area of horizon, angular momentum, and charges of black holes. Professor Alaee taught a variety of undergraduate mathematics courses at Clark University, Harvard University, University of Toronto, University of Alberta, and Memorial University.

He also received an M.S. in mathematics and B.S. degrees in both math and physics from Utah State University. He arrived at Clark in 2019. Professor Ream’s research area, broadly speaking is geometric analysis. Geometric analysts seek to use analytic tools to prove existence, or non-existence, of various geometric structures. In particular, he is interested in the existence of minimal surfaces which have minimal area for a given constraint. Concrete examples of minimal surfaces are soap films, which have least area of all surfaces with a fixed boundary. Robert is also interested in special Kähler metrics. He has taught a variety of courses at Clark, including Discrete Math, Honors Calculus, and Modern Algebra.

A Career Planning Course for Parents By Sally KearsleyCourtesy of the National Association of Colleges and Employers Your son or daughter just left for (or returned to) college but doesn’t seem to have a clue as to what he or she wants to major in, let alone choose as a career. Don’t worry, this is not unusual, although you might wish your child had a little more sense of direction. Choosing a career is a process students need to go through — and they go through the stages of this process at different rates of speed. The steps include: Assessing skills, interests, and abilities (an important first step to choosing an appropriate career). Exploring majors and career options. Experimenting with possible career options. Organizing and conducting a job or graduate school search. You can assist and support your child in each of these stages. But what can — or should — you do? Here’s your own career planning timetable. Careers 101 — For Parents of First-Year Students During their first year or so of college, students will be involved (formally or informally) in assessing their skills, interests, and abilities. They will do this through finding success (or failure) in courses they take, involvement in campus activities, discussions with their friends and faculty, and by being exposed to and trying out different ideas and experiences. Most students enter college with a very limited knowledge of the vast array of courses and majors available to them. When they begin to delve into studies that are new to them, even those who entered with a plan may be drawn to different options. This is an exciting time for students. What You Can Do to Help Support your child’s exploration of new areas of study and interests. This, after all, is what education is all about. Affirm what you know to be areas of skill and ability he or she has consistently demonstrated. Sometimes students overlook these and need to be reminded. Talk with your son or daughter about the courses and activities he or she is enjoying. Students discover new things about themselves throughout the college experience. Your willingness to listen and be a sounding board will keep you in the loop. Don’t panic if your child is excited about majoring in something like English, history, or art. These can be excellent choices, particularly if they are a good match for a student’s interests and skills. Support your son or daughter’s responsible involvement in campus activities but urge this to be balanced with maintaining achievement in the classroom. Urge your child to seek assistance in the campus career center. Most institutions have assessment instruments and counselors to help students to define their skills, interests, and abilities. Careers 201 — For Parents of Second-Year Students Generally, during the second year of college, a student begins to explore majors and career options more seriously. Many colleges and universities require that new students take a broad range of subjects to promote this exploration. What You Can Do to Help Don’t insist upon a decision about a major or possible career choice immediately. If you sense that your child’s indecision is a barrier to positive progress, urge that he or she look for assistance in the career center. Students often have difficulty making a “final” choice because they fear they may make a wrong choice and close off options Suggest that your son or daughter talk with faculty and career advisers about potential choices. Direct your child to family, friends, or colleagues who are in fields in which he or she has an interest. “Informational interviewing” with people can be extremely helpful at this stage. Steer your child toward a source of information. Many campuses have a career consultant or mentoring network of alumni in various career fields who are willing to share information with students about their careers. These resources are invaluable both in this exploratory stage and later as students are seeking internships and jobs. Careers 301 — For Parents of “Mid-Career” Students During the sophomore year and throughout the junior year, it is important for students to experiment with possible career options. They can do this in a variety of ways: internships, cooperative education programs, summer jobs, campus jobs, and responsible volunteer experiences both on campus and in the local community. This is a critical time for your support and understanding. What You Can Do to Help Encourage your child to use the resources available at the campus career center. Experts there can assist your child in preparing a good resume and finding opportunities to test career choices. Most career centers are in direct contact with employers. Tell your child that you understand the importance of gaining exposure to and experience in his or her field of career interest. Broadening experience through involvement outside the classroom is a valuable use of time. Internships or summer experiences may be non-paying. Also, a good opportunity may be in a distant location. Discuss your financial expectations with your child before a commitment is made. Don’t conduct the internship or summer job search for your child. It’s a great help to provide networking contacts or names of people who may be helpful; however, making the contact and speaking for your child deprives him or her of an important learning experience—and may make a poor impression on the future employer. Careers 401 — For Parents of Graduating Seniors The senior year is when organizing and conducting a job search or graduate school search begins in earnest. It is also a time when students are heavily involved in more advanced courses and often have more responsible roles in campus and/or volunteer activities. Balancing these important pursuits and setting priorities is a constant challenge for seniors. You are probably anxious for this young adult to make a decision—and yet, he or she may be moving toward closure more slowly than you would wish. What You Can Do to Help Suggest that he or she use the campus career center throughout the senior year. These offices provide assistance in preparation for the job search. Offerings may include: Workshops and individual help with resume and cover letter writing, interviewing, and other job-search skills, Individual and group career advising Job-search resources On-campus interviewing opportunities Alumni career consultant or mentor programs Don’t nag your child about not having a job yet. This will often have the reverse effect. Use positive reinforcement. Offer to assist by sending information you may have found about your child’s target career field and/or job listings that may be of interest. Listen for indications from your child that you are getting carried away—and back off. Don’t call potential employers to intervene for your child. Contact with potential employers is the candidate’s responsibility. Be prepared to support your child through the ups and downs of the job and graduate school search. It can be a bumpy road—not every desired job or graduate school acceptance will come through. Your student will need reassurance that for every door that closes, another opens. A Family’s Guide to Career Development By Thomas J. DenhamCourtesy of the National Association of Colleges and Employers The most valuable things parents can do to help a student with career planning are: Listen Be open to ideas Help your student find information Here are eight more things you can do to help: 1. Encourage your child to visit the career center Next time you visit campus, drop into the career services office and pick up a business card from one of the career advisers. When your son or daughter is feeling anxious about his/her future, offer the card and say, “Please call this person. He (or she) can help you.” Many students use their first semester to “settle into” college life, and so the spring semester of the freshman year is the optimal time to start using career center services. Ask your student (in an off-handed way), “Have you visited the career center?” If you hear, “You only go there when you are a senior,” then it’s time to reassure him/her that meeting with a career counselor can take place at any point—and should take place frequently—throughout a college career. Many centers offer a full range of career development and job-search help, including: Mock interviews A network of alumni willing to talk about their jobs and careers A library of books (including an online library of information) on a wide range of careers Workshops on writing resumes and cover letters A recruiting program Individual advising 2. Advise your student to write a resume Writing a resume can be a “reality test” and can help a student identify weak areas that require improvement. Suggest that your student get sample resumes from the career center. You can review resume drafts for grammar, spelling, and content, but recommend that the final product be critiqued by a career center professional. 3. Challenge your student to become “occupationally literate.” Ask: “Do you have any ideas about what you might want to do when you graduate?” If your student seems unsure, you can talk about personal qualities you see as talents and strengths. You can also recommend: Taking a “self-assessment inventory,” such as FOCUS2. Talking to favorite faculty members Researching a variety of interesting career fields and employers A career decision should be a process and not a one-time, last-minute event. 4. Emphasize the importance of internships The career center will not “place” your child in a job at graduation. Colleges grant degrees, but not job guarantees, so having relevant experience in this competitive job market is critical. Your son or daughter can sample career options by completing internships and experimenting with summer employment opportunities or volunteer work. Why an internship? Employers are interested in communication, problem-solving, and administrative skills, which can be developed through internships. Employers look for experience on a student’s resume and often hire from within their own internship programs. Having a high GPA is not enough. A strong letter of recommendation from an internship supervisor may tip the scale of an important interview in their favor. 5. Encourage extracurricular involvement Part of experiencing college life is to be involved and active outside the classroom. Interpersonal and leadership skills—qualities valued by future employers—are often developed in extracurricular activities. 6. Help your student to stay up-to-date with current events Employers will expect students to know what is happening around them. Buy your student a subscription to The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal. 7. Teach the value of networking Introduce your student to people who have the careers/jobs that are of interest. Suggest your son or daughter contact people in your personal and professional networks for information on summer jobs. Encourage your child to “shadow” someone in the workplace to increase awareness of interesting career fields. 8. Help the career center Call your campus career center when you have a summer, part-time, or full-time job opening. The staff will help you find a hard-working student. If your company hires interns, have the internships listed in the career center.

Fall 2024 Virtual Jobs & Internships Fair Clark University’s Career Connections Center invites you to attend the Fall 2024 Virtual Jobs & Internships Fair on Wednesday, October 2nd, 2024 from 1:00 – 4:00 PM EST, on Handshake’s virtual fairs platform. Click the link below to register for the fair and sign up for 1:1 meetings and group info sessions with 45+ participating employers, including: Amazon Operations, AmeriCorps, Casa de Esperanza de los Ninos, UnitedHealth Group, City Year, Open Sky Community Services, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Goodwill Industries of Northern New England (Goodwill NNE), Emergent Holdings, Semester in the City in Boston (part of the College for Social Innovation), Sevita MA Pediatrics, Seven Hills Foundation, Worcester Public Schools, and more! Event Link: https://clarku.joinhandshake.com/edu/career_fairs/50787 What to Do Before the Fair Preparing for a virtual fair is like preparing to meet with organizations on campus, but you’ll need to keep a few extra things in mind. The Career Connections Center will help guide you through each step of navigating the virtual fair. You will need to: Prepare your tech Prepare your Handshake profile Register and build your career fair schedule Your virtual fair experience might include one-on-one sessions with recruiters and/or larger group sessions with recruiters and other student participants. It’s important to prepare well for both scenarios and to be ready to interact with recruiters via both video and text chat. STEP ONE: PICK A DEVICE AND BROWSER Desktops and laptops perform best during the Handshake virtual career fairs; the recommended browsers are Chrome and Firefox. STEP TWO: TEST YOUR CONNECTION Testing your connection is highly recommended to ensure a smooth virtual career fair experience. Before the fair, ensure you have a strong internet connection in the location where you plan to log on to attend the fair. You can test your audio and video by joining your sessions with employers up to five minutes early. You’ll need to make sure you’ve allowed microphone and video access in your app or browser in order to participate. While a webcam is not required to participate in the virtual fair, you might want to use video when you speak with recruiters, especially during one-on-one sessions. Ensuring your technology works before the fair begins will help you feel prepared and confident when you speak with the recruiters. STEP THREE: ASK FOR HELP You can review Handshake’s Video Requirements and Troubleshooting for Students if you need additional technical support. You also can reach us at cservices@clarku.edu if you need support and want to connect with someone in the Career Connections Center. Prepare Your Handshake Profile For the virtual fair, you must sign up for sessions in advance to meet with organizations. This allows you to choose who you’re meeting with and when. To make sure you’re putting your best foot forward, you’ll want to update your resume and Handshake profile. STEP ONE: UPDATE YOUR PROFILE Employers will likely look over your profile before meeting with you during a group or one-on-one session, and may even have specific questions for you based on the information they find. Updating your profile is easy by uploading your resume to Handshake. Click on your profile image, scroll down to Documents, and upload your resume. Pro Tip: Update your resume first and get expert feedback from the Career Lab on format and content — upload it to your Documents and you’ll receive feedback within one to three days (the feedback will be at the bottom of your resume document in Handshake). If you are a graduate student, contact your career center or department for feedback on your resume. STEP TWO: FILL OUT YOUR CAREER INTERESTS We also strongly recommend you add your Career Interests. Click on your picture icon, select Career Interests, and fill in the job types, job roles, locations, and industries that you are interested in. STEP THREE: MAKE YOUR PROFILE VISIBLE To participate in virtual career fairs, you will need to adjust your Handshake privacy settings, found on the Privacy and Settings page of your dashboard. For one-on-one sessions, you will need to select the “Employers” privacy setting, while for group sessions, a “Community” privacy setting is required to participate. You may choose to change your settings back to “private” after the fair. If you forget to change your privacy settings, don’t worry! When signing up for one-on-one or group sessions from the virtual fair page, Handshake will prompt you through a pop-up window to change to the required setting. Register and Build Your Fair Schedule To participate in the fair, you must register for the event on Handshake and you must sign up for employer sessions at least one minute in advance of the session start time. If you do not register and sign up for sessions, you will be unable to meet with employers. Once you’ve registered for the fair, stay in Handshake to review the list of participating employers and sign up for one-on-one and group sessions. We also encourage you to check back frequently, as new employers will be added. Watch this quick video, How to Register and Sign Up for the Virtual Career Fair, which shows you how to register for the fairs and sign up for sessions, or read this Handshake Help Article. WHY CAN’T I REGISTER FOR A ONE-ON-ONE WITH AN EMPLOYER? While group sessions are open to all students, some employers have set qualifications to define which students can register for their one-on-one meetings. To ensure you qualify for an employer session, make sure you have filled out the following fields on your profile: Grad year, major, and GPA, which can be found on your profile. To ensure your GPA is visible, uncheck “hide from employers” in your profile. Work authorization status, which can be found on the Privacy and Settings page.You can learn more about work authorization status here. Please note: We have asked participating organizations to keep their one-on-one preferences relaxed to allow opportunities for career exploration and networking. What to Do During the Fair Arrive on time for your session. This shows respect, good time management skills, and that you are dependable. You can log in to your session early, but if you’re late, you may miss it completely. Cancel in advance when possible. If you need to cancel your session, please cancel as far in advance as possible through the “Your Sessions” tab. This will also open the time up for another student to participate. Maintain eye contact and smile. Look at the screen and try to really listen to what the employer has to say. Active listening enables a more meaningful, productive conversation. Also, don’t forget to smile and show positive energy. Take notes for easier follow-up. If you have multiple meetings scheduled, it may be difficult to remember which recruiter said what. Taking down a few key notes will also make it easier for you to follow up after the fair. Make an impression. To build personalized connections, we recommend you select to show yourself via video if possible, particularly in one-on-one sessions. However, if you feel more comfortable, you also have the option for audio only or text-based chat. If interrupted — don’t panic! Since many of us have been working from home for the past year, people have come to understand that life happens. Do your best to quiet the interruption and continue the conversation. You can always switch your video off or revert to the text chat feature if needed. Request contact information. Whether or not you are actively seeking an opportunity, don’t forget to ask for the recruiter’s contact information at the end of your session. Otherwise, it may be difficult to find later. What to Do After the Fair Send thank you emails to employers you met. Even if you are not actively seeking an opportunity, you may want to keep in touch with any recruiters with whom you had a productive or positive conversation. They will appreciate the professional courtesy. In your email, mention something you found interesting or learned from your conversation. If you are interested in being considered for a position, say so, and reiterate the qualities you could bring to the organization. Connect with recruiters on LinkedIn. Immediately following the fair, you should also connect with any employers you’ve met with on LinkedIn. Remember to add a personal note in your connection request, reminding them who you are. Build your professional network! Apply for posted internships or jobs. If you are seeking opportunities, apply for internships or jobs on Handshake and company websites. Once you’ve applied, follow up by email to let the recruiter know you’ve submitted an application. This is appropriate before the standard two-week application follow-up, because you already have made a personal connection.

Here are a few quick tips on how to prepare: Plan to dress appropriately. First impressions matter; business casual attire is required for the career fair. Check out which companies are registered for the fair on the Handshake event page. Click on “View All Employers” on the fair event page to see a list of all employers registered, a description of the companies, and the types of positions they are hiring for (internships, full time, or part time). You also can view the current positions posted by an employer in Handshake to get a sense of their roles, requirements, and expectations by clicking on the company’s page and viewing their current posted positions. To prioritize your time at the fair, make a list of the top five to 10 employers you want to introduce yourself to and learn more about. Practice your “career pitch.” A career pitch explains, in 30 seconds or less, who you are, what your major or skills are, your career goals, and why you’re interested in the company. You can highlight things such as: you’re looking for an internship in a certain industry to get a sense of potential career paths; you’re seeking a full-time opportunity after graduation that enables you to use a particular set of skills; or your values align with the brand of the company and you’re planning to apply for their internship program. What to Bring to an In-Person Fair Bring several printed copies of your resume. Be sure to have your resume reviewed by Clark’s Career Services staff for proper formatting, industry keywords, and best practices on how to highlight your unique skills and experiences. Bring a notepad and a pen so you can take notes on what you learn from employers and recruiters when you inquire about how to connect with additional managers. The representative at the fair may not be the person hiring for the department or opportunity in which you’re interested. A way to hold on to the business cards you collect. Ask for business cards from people with whom you plan to follow up, not from every representative at the fair. It’s easy to fall back on asking for a card if you aren’t comfortable networking. Take this opportunity to make connections! How to Connect with Employers at an In-Person Fair Introduce yourself with your career pitch (see above under How to Prepare for tips on your career pitch). Say “hello” to the representatives and welcome them to Clark — employers sometimes send alumni to represent their company! Talk about your career interests and ask questions about the company and their opportunities. Bring your positive attitude and be sensitive to other students who may be waiting to speak with the same employer by keeping your questions brief and offering to follow up at a later time. Be courteous of employer materials. Always check with employers before taking materials from their tables. Send a thank you letter or email to representatives you meet at the fair, even if they don’t have an immediate opening for a position. The connections you make now can be invaluable later. Reaffirm your interest, follow up with direct questions you may have, and say thank you. Here’s a sample message:Dear (insert representative’s name),We met two weeks ago at the Clark University Career Fair. I enjoyed speaking with you about (insert company name and position or conversation topic) and was impressed by the company philosophy and opportunities. I wanted to reaffirm my interest in the (insert position or potential program) at your company. Given the qualifications and skills that you highlighted as ideal for this role, I believe that my (insert your related experience and interests) would be a great fit for the opportunity. I have attached an updated copy of the resume I gave you at the Career Fair.

For students looking for more than “just a job,” connecting with alumni helps students validate their passions, realize their potential, and set goals to help them move closer to finding meaningful work in the future. For alumni, the job shadow program is a chance to reflect upon their own career path and share their wisdom with students who are eager to learn. In-Person and Remote Options Available The in-person job shadow allows students to experience a “day in the life” of someone working in a field they are interested in pursuing. The virtual job shadow provides students with many of the same benefits of an in-person job shadow with the added flexibility of being able to connect with alumni from all over the world. What participants are saying about the Alumni Job Shadow Program “I was so thrilled to be selected to participate in the ClarkCONNECT Alumni Job Shadow Program! Since graduating from Clark in 2008, I’ve sought opportunities to stay connected to current students and Clark itself. I was lucky to be paired with Eesha Kashif ’21 MBA ’22, and we hit it off almost immediately. I was able to share my own experiences navigating the post-college world and share my experiences since I’ve worked in a few different industries since leaving Clark. Eesha was an absolute delight and we have maintained contact even beyond the job shadow program. It’s been so exciting following her journey and being able to share my own experiences and professional insights with her. It’s also been a great developmental opportunity for my own career!” Matt Pettengill ’08, Alumni Host “Meeting Matt was one of my favorite Clark experiences. Unfortunately, we could not connect in person due to COVID-19. However, we organized a Zoom call and I learned all about his work at UNUM, the realm of business development, as well as the insurance industry in general. I’m so glad to have found a mentor and friend in him. He always listens to my stories about school and is consistently there for me as a professional and personal cheerleader.” Eesha Kashif ’21 MBA ’22, Alumni Job Shadow Program Participant What Does a Job Shadow Look Like? Curious as to what an in-person job shadow looks like? Each day is as unique as the student and alum who plan it together. The following are examples of recent in-person job shadow experiences. “Maddie from City Year Boston did a wonderful job showing us around. She asked me what my interests were and created a whole schedule for me accordingly. I had the opportunity to get connected to the Project Manager, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Director, and many other fascinating people. I really appreciated being able to see how an NGO works in the office as well as being a part of meetings and asking questions. Being able to meet three Clark Alumni and hear about their transition from college into the working world was amazing. I was truly positively surprised by how much I could learn in just one day and happy to be part of the program. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a one-day experience in which they can explore their opportunities after college. Most importantly, it was a great networking experience!” Kadijha Kuanda ’22 “I completed the job shadow experience with Beth at Digital Insight Innovations in Watertown, MA. In addition to holding an exciting and challenging position in the data world, this alum is also a wonderful mentor and provided me with useful information and advice about careers and life. Throughout the day, my fellow shadows and I listened in on project meetings, met with a variety of employees in different career areas, and spoke with our host about her background and experiences. Speaking with one of her co-workers caused me to think more seriously about a career I was previously uncertain about and the encouragement from everyone we met in the office has boosted my confidence in finding a position in a company with a positive and healthy work culture. This was the best experience I have had through the Career Connections Center, and I would happily encourage other students to try it out.” Sheila Ford ’21 “I completed my job shadow experience with Alyssa who is the newsroom manager at Weill Cornell Medicine Office of External Affairs. I came into the day with the goal of learning about non-journalism careers and definitely accomplished just that. My host was kind enough to arrange meetings between me and other coworkers from different departments (e.g., social media, development, marketing) who worked alongside her. Most of her coworkers also had prior journalism experience, so the meetings were helpful to see what my options look like. I also met with new hires closer to my age who talked about their decision to go to grad school and how they entered the field. I was surprised with how warm and welcoming the corporate space could be. I would recommend this experience to others, especially those who are interested in learning about a career or field they know little to nothing about.” Gari De Ramos ’21 The virtual job shadow provides students with the same benefits of an in-person job shadow with the added flexibility of being able to connect with alumni from all over the world. The following are examples of recent virtual job shadow experiences. “I completed my job shadow with Brendan who is employed as a Geodetic Surveyor at REIB OÜ in Estonia. My alumni host made the whole process comfortable even though I went into it a little intimidated. I was inspired by my host to not make any decisions based on what other people think you should be doing or where you should be in terms of experience. This opportunity prepared me to take more risks and to reach out to more alumni because I learned that most alumni on ClarkCONNECT are willing to give you advice! I was surprised about how non-intimidating the process was. I learned I am capable, smart, and should be confident in the steps I take towards the career I want. I would recommend this program to peers because it is a perfect first step to networking, and gives you a taste of the field you are looking to get into. All of the career resources can be really overwhelming, so if you don’t know where to start — this is a good place!” Danielle Hall ’23 “I completed my job shadow with Christina who has worked in pharma since she graduated and is currently employed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. During our meetings she gave me an overview of her career progression and answered any questions I had. I am certainly more informed in the pharma career path now and joining the workforce seems a little less daunting. She gave me a lot of helpful information and tips about navigating the job search. Christina was very easy to get along with, which made our meetings very relaxed. She gave me amazing advice and helped me feel more confident about my future. I just feel so much more prepared now. She is the mentor I needed.” Tara Stein ’21 “For the program, I was matched with Kelsey of Year Up Boston. Overall, this was a great opportunity for me to connect with a recent alum in my major who leveraged their Clark experience to work in industry sectors that I am interested in doing future work in. The job shadow program was a great incentive to further go through Clark’s resources on finding a career, exploring my interests, and how to present the best version of myself to a future employer. It challenged me to do research on future organizations I might work with in my discipline and get serious about my immediate post-college steps. All throughout my undergraduate years, I have never been worried about ‘what I can do with my major,’ but the alumni job shadow program definitely helped me to visualize more concretely the types of positions and tasks I could be prepared to do successfully. I would definitely recommend this program to other students for the way in which it spurs you to research various employers and positions, gain relevant industry experience, and market yourself as a competitive candidate.” Ian Hirons ’21 Program Eligibility The ClarkCONNECT Alumni Job Shadow Program is open to current undergraduate students in all years.

Testimonials “I really enjoyed this experience because it made me think about what I do in the classroom that is effective and worth sharing. My student had a list of well-thought-out questions about various aspects of ESOL education that made me reflect on how much I love this job and why I do it.” Alumni Volunteer “I was excited to participate in the job shadow program. I care deeply about mentorship, and the program only reaffirmed my interest in supporting undergrads and law students. To the extent I can provide insights into the work our organization does, I’m excited to continue participating.” Alumni Volunteer “I am so jealous that Clarkies get to have these experiences — what a cool opportunity for students and alums alike!” Alumni Volunteer “Through the program, I realized that one is capable of excelling if you’re surrounded by people who inspire you to do better. I was so impressed with the image that our school has out there, and this challenged me to maintain that standard. Every now and then when the host introduced me to an attorney, there was always a Clarkie doing something good out there.” A Third Year International Development and Social Change Major “I would recommend this program to my peers because it is a step outside of our comfort zone in terms of what we do at Clark. It gives us the chance to see what we can do with our degrees after Clark. It can also help us decide if we would like this possible career in the future.” A Fourth Year Biology Major “I felt like I really benefited from some of the meetings in which we talked about graduating from college and starting to work, and I left at the end of the day feeling a bit calmer and more prepared.” A Third Year Media, Culture and Arts Major Contact the Program Manager For questions about the ClarkCONNECT Alumni Job Shadow Program, please email Sawsan Berjawi, Senior Associate Director of Operations and Communications, sberjawi@clarku.edu.

Once you connect, you can start to build a relationship or ask for additional contacts that might be of value for you.

From these connections, you can discover pathways for internships, research collaborations, networking and employment opportunities, advice, and guidance about careers and industries. Here are a few tips for making a new connection on ClarkCONNECT: Send an email or LinkedIn/ClarkCONNECT message to introduce yourself and briefly explain why you’re reaching out and what you hope to learn through conversation. Make a list of questions to ask contacts when you connect so that you’re prepared. Here’s a helpful list of questions to ask. Be genuine by demonstrating your interest in your new contact’s experiences, establishing what you have in common with them, and explaining what you hope to learn from them. Be respectful and professional by editing your message for spelling and grammatical errors. Take the time to craft a well-thought-out message. First impressions are important in establishing new connections. Don’t be discouraged if people don’t respond right away. Let them know that you’ll follow-up, then be sure to follow through by sending a second message after a certain period of time (typically a week or more). If you do connect, be sure to send a thank you email or note! LinkedIn is a powerful networking resource of 70 million professionals around the globe representing 150 industries, including 30,000+ Clark alumni. You can create a free account to begin expanding your network of connections. How do I connect with people on LinkedIn? When connecting with others on LinkedIn, you will be prompted to describe how you know the other person through a set of choices that LinkedIn provides. You also will have the option to include a personal note along with the connection request, a message that the person on the other end will be able to see. You should customize this message to describe the nature of why you are connecting. In it, briefly include: An introduction (“Hi, I’m a junior studying International Development at Clark University…”). An explanation of your common interests or shared affiliation (“I see you were an athlete at Clark; I’m a student-athlete on the baseball team”). A brief “ask” of what you hope to learn or do (“I’d welcome the opportunity to learn more about your career path into investment banking through a 30-minute phone call at your convenience”). Sincere thanks (“Thanks so much for considering my connection and I look forward to your response”). How do I Connect with Alumni on LinkedIn? To connect with Clark alumni on LinkedIn, you need to first ensure that you have listed Clark University in the “Education” section of your LinkedIn profile. Once your profile is complete, simply go to Clark University’s main LinkedIn page and click on the alumni tab on the column on the left. Once there, you’ll see an ongoing list of alumni that you can easily filter by industry, location, job title, company, or keyword. One thing to keep in mind: Your LinkedIn profile is often the first link that appears when someone searches your name via Google. How to Network Think about your strengths and interests by reflecting on your current positive and negative experiences. Assess your current connections by identifying the people who most align with your values and interests and with whom you should connect to diversify your perspective. Connect with curiosity by asking questions without the pressure of a formal networking event or a formal ask for a job or internship. Look for opportunities to connect with people and experiences through social networks, clubs, volunteering, and job boards. Cultivate your network by showing genuine interest in people’s experiences and by keeping in touch with those who took the time to connect with you. Sample Messaging Want to start making a professional connection with alumni but not sure where to start? Here are a few sample messages to help guide you: Graduate School “Hi Alumni, My name is Student and I am a junior at Clark double majoring in Spanish and psychology.

The template below will help you develop a customized strategy that combines all three methods for a more comprehensive search. Download template Also, check out different job boards to identify positions you might be interested in. Even if you’re not ready to apply for an internship or job, these sites are a great way to see what’s out there. Follow These Steps Step 1: Find Posted Positions That Interest You Find the right job boards for your field, industry, level of experience, and/or geographic location. Depending on the industry, some of the best jobs may be posted on smaller, “niche” sites. Here are a few to get you started: Handshake: Job board especially for companies looking for students and new graduates. ClarkCONNECT: Jobs posted by Clark alumni. Indeed.com: Large, general job board that pulls from other sites for a comprehensive listing. Additional job boards: Search listings on job boards for your industry; websites for professional organizations; or visit organizations you might like to work for, as their sites might contain information about pursuing careers in the field. Step 2: Get Interviews Through Referrals (Networking) Contact the people in your network. Encourage them to send job positions your way or to refer you to job interviews. Expand your network by meeting alumni and others in your line of work. People you already know: Friends, family, and friends of family members Faculty and department administrators Fellow student club members Colleagues from work, volunteering, or internshipsConnect with alumni who might help you. ClarkCONNECT: Search alumni profiles and attend events LinkedIn: Most alumni indicate their Clark affiliations on their profiles Alumni chapter gatherings PRO TIP: Don’t just ask for a job. Instead, let them know what kind(s) of opportunities you are looking for, and ask them if they have any suggestions for jobs, job boards, or people to talk to. This broader request is more likely to lead to useful referrals. Step 3: Create Your Own Opportunity (Optional) Some organizations will create a customized internship for you if you show an interest. Approach them with a spirit of curiosity to explore possibilities. Take these steps: Define your internship goals: What do want to learn? What skills do you want to use or practice? Identify organizations where you might like to intern. Determine the best person to speak with at that organization. Is there someone who can introduce you? A colleague, friend, alumni, or faculty member? If so, ask that person to arrange a meeting. If not, send an inquiry email describing your interests and asking for a short meeting or phone call to discuss possibilities. Attach your resume.

To pick the best graduate program for your needs, consider first your long-term career goals. What would you like to be doing five or ten years from now? Then, consider how a degree or credential will help you attain those goals. To explore your career options, see our Explore Careers page or make an appointment with your career adviser. Finding (and Choosing) a Program Here are four ways to find the right graduate program for you: Consider Clark’s Accelerated B.A./Master’s Program. Clark’s ADP may be the right choice for you. Learn more on their site and look for the on-campus information sessions every spring. Search online guides. Peterson’s and U.S. News and World Report offer large databases of U.S. graduate programs. Ask people in your network for suggestions. Ask your faculty, Clark alumni on ClarkCONNECT or LinkedIn, or others you know in your chosen field what graduate programs they recommend. Attend a conference in your chosen field. At professional conferences, you can ask older professionals what programs they recommend and talk to graduate program reps in the exhibit hall. Many professional conferences have student rates and scholarships; ask your faculty for conference recommendations. Additional considerations: Focus the program, not the school. Picking an undergraduate college or university is often about choosing an entire school and everything it offers (size, location, degrees offered, culture, etc.). By contrast, picking a graduate program is much more about picking a specific program within a university that offers the faculty, research priorities, and facilities that match your interests. Once you identify a shortlist of programs that match your research interests, consider other factors like location, climate, campus culture, etc. Don’t do it alone. You’ll have the best chance for success if you have a network of support for the search and application process. This may include friends, family, and alumni in your chosen field; Clark faculty; staff in the Career Connections Center, Writing Center, or Prestigious Fellowships Office; and others. Process Overview and Timeline Application Cycle Many deadlines fall between January and March, but some programs have rolling admission. Read each school’s information and plan accordingly! You may have a slight advantage if you apply at least a month before the deadline. Know the requirements well ahead of time and try to prepare your application 6 months to a year in advance. Download our application timeline here For law school and medical school applications, follow the timelines given by the Clark Pre-Health and Pre-Law programs. Materials You Will Need: Standardized tests (varies by program) Letters of recommendation Essay(s) Transcript(s) Resume/Curriculum Vitae Standardized Tests Overview: Most standardized tests for graduate school are administered through computer adaptive testing. Scores are generally valid for five years. Required tests may vary; check with each graduate program to which you plan to apply. Timeline: Begin studying by the winter break of your junior year; a practice test will give you a baseline and help you identify where you need to study most. For graduate school, take your first test by late spring of your junior year so you have time to study and take it again by early fall of your senior year, if necessary. For law school and med school testing applications, follow the timelines given by the Clark Pre-Health and Pre-Law programs. Fees and Scholarships: Standardized tests cost $100–$300 and more. You may qualify for a fee reduction or waiver for these tests; however, you must allow yourself time to complete the necessary paperwork. Check the latest requirements and deadlines on each of the testing sites below by searching for “fee waiver.” Details: The following websites will provide you with specific information on test dates and content of testing materials. GRE GRE Subject Tests (Biology, Chemistry, Literature, Math, Physics, Psychology) GMAT LSAT MCAT Praxis Series (For teachers) Competitive Scores: To find out the score you need to earn in order to be competitive for a specific program, contact the program directly and ask them for the average standardized test scores for their admitted students. Recommendation Letters Several (two to five) letters of recommendation may be required for each application; check application requirements carefully for each program to which you are applying. For great letters of recommendation, follow these etiquette guidelines: Ask people who know you well (professors, employers, or others) to write on your behalf. For graduate school, at least one letter should be from a faculty member — ideally from your chosen area of graduate study. Meet in person (or, if necessary, call) to ask for letters of recommendation. Avoid asking over email. Be direct: “Would you be willing to write a strong letter of recommendation for me?” If a person does not feel comfortable writing you a strong recommendation, ask someone else. If you will require several letters from the same person, immediately let them know how many you will need. Discuss the purpose of the letter with the writer (e.g., graduate school, employment). It may be helpful to provide a resume/curriculum vitae for the writer. Discuss how the person will deliver the letter. Will they send their recommendations directly to a graduate program, or upload to AMCAS? Research this before you ask for the letters. Ask for recommendations several months in advance, so the writer has enough time to draft exceptional letters. Optional: Refer your letter writers to the Career Connection Center’s page for faculty, where they’ll find tips on writing letters of recommendation. Essays The way in which you express your experience and portray your motivations in an essay can have a major impact on your ability to be accepted to more competitive programs. Budget a substantial amount of time to writing your essays. Some graduate programs require more than one essay. Write a Graduate School Essay that Will Knock Their Socks Off (Petersons.com) How to Write a Graduate School Personal Statement (Kaptest.com) Personal Statement vs. Statement of Purpose (Gograd.org) Transcripts You can arrange to have your transcript sent to graduate schools from the Registrar’s Office by mail or in person. Note: If you took classes at other institutions or studied abroad, you will need to contact these programs to request an official transcript be sent to your graduate schools. Resume or Curriculum Vitae Depending on the program, you may need a resume or a curriculum vitae for your graduate school application. What’s the difference? A curriculum vitae (CV) is an unabridged (complete) listing of one’s academic and research work. By contrast, a resume (in the United States) is a 1-2 page summary of your work experience and skills. Templates: Please see the Career Connection Center’s Resources page for resume and CV templates. Resume review: Come to the Career Connection Center’s Career Lab or make an appointment with your career adviser. CV review: Make an appointment with your career adviser, and/or have your CV reviewed by a trusted faculty member. Resources These resources represent some of the most frequently visited websites.

The Spring 2025 application has closed. The application cycle for Summer 2025 is open. The priority deadline to apply for Summer 2025 is Thursday, May 22, 2025. Rolling applications are accepted until Monday, July 7, 2025. Apply Here Please allow up to 5 business days to receive communication on your application status. Video Guide: How to Apply to the Academic Internship Program What Is an Academic Internship at Clark? An academic internship is a credit-bearing, career-related work experience of limited duration in which an individual takes on responsible roles outside of the traditional university environment. Academic internships may take place in a nonprofit organization, government office, or for-profit business. Depending on the employer, some internships are paid. Rising sophomores, juniors, or seniors may earn academic credit for internships during the fall, spring, or summer terms. Overview of the application process: Secure your internship. Find a full-time faculty member to act as your faculty sponsor for the internship. With your faculty sponsor, plan the academic portion of your academic internship. The Faculty Sponsor must sign the Faculty Sponsor Approval Form electronically before you submit your application. This form is found below. Apply to the Academic Internship Program through the Apply Here link above. Once you are approved, follow instructions to register your academic internship with the Office of the Registrar. Additional Steps for international students needing CPT: Once you receive approval from the Career Connections Center for your academic internship, apply through the ISSO Portal to receive CPT from ISSO. Wait to receive your I-20 before starting your internship. The ISSO cannot backdate CPT applications. You are not legally allowed to work in the United States until you’ve received your I-20 with CPT work authorization. Application Deadlines: While we accept applications on a rolling basis, the application deadline to avoid a later registration fee is one week before the drop/add deadline set by the University. This allows time to process your application and register on time. Go to Clark’s academic calendar. Graduate students: If you are a graduate student, including graduating seniors in the summer of the ADP program, do not use this application process. Instead, work with your academic department to obtain credit. International Students: The Academic Internship Program is available to undergraduate Clark students in good academic standing regardless of citizenship or immigration status. If you need CPT, please see the instructions above. For further questions about CPT, please contact ISSO.

It has highlighted the importance of working both in and out of the classroom. I honestly cannot emphasize enough the value that doing an internship has added to my college experience!” – Kasyan Green How did you first find out about your internship, and how did you secure this opportunity? “I first found out about this internship opportunity via Indeed.com. Then, I recognized that my friend and Clark alum, John Pisacreta, works for the company. After talking to him and discovering that he also did an Accounting Internship for them, I figured it would be a good internship to apply for. I used his name as a reference and heard back from them soon after. The next steps were a phone screening interview and an on-site interview. A couple of weeks later, I received a call asking if I would like to accept the position.” – Kyle Coughlin How did your internship experience affect your perception of the industry or role, and how did it inform your future career goals/plans? Did it confirm what you want to do next? Did you decide to move in a different direction? “This internship made me realize how much I love working in a startup. Even as hectic as it can get, everything is new and exciting and we have to be as flexible and supportive as we can when things don’t go exactly how we want it to be. Also, from this internship I’ve realized that I might want to pursue being a program manager.” – Nadia Fakhrol “Some of the highlights of my internship has been in the second week where I led a workshop on critical media literacy and one of my campers built a poster of inclusion and how they would want to see the world. Having been able to convey the biases of the media and how it affects people of color and seeing that reciprocated has been one of the best moments. Being able to engage all these campers from different cultures and backgrounds into such conversation has been a strength that I have developed.” – Anisha Hassan Has your academic component changed at all? If so, how? I started the internship thinking I would research on if these resilience building programs work or not, however my paper has evolved to cultural competency, and how that is essential to working in a multicultural environment such as camp.” – Anisha Hassan Previous Site Supervisor Experiences Was the student’s academic preparation adequate for the internship? Is there anything Clark University can do to ensure a better learning outcome and experience for future academic interns? “Our intern has a strong understanding of creative writing, grammar, and communications which I am assuming is reflective of her education at Clark University. In addition to her academics, she also has amazing soft skills which will make her a great future employee for a lucky employer.” – Pulse Magazine “Our interns’ academic preparation was great for the internship. We look forward to working with future Clark University students and offering them internship opportunities at the Center.” – Worcester Youth Center “Our intern has set the bar very high for our next intern. Kudos to Clark for helping prepare her. Her academic preparation was exceptional.” – Center for Health Impact Academic Internship ProgramFunding for Opportunities academic department internship listings Contact Information Career Connections Center Office Location Shaich Family Alumni and Student Engagement Center (ASEC Building)939 Main St.Worcester, MA 01610 1-508-793-7258 1-508-421-3752 Fax cservices@clarku.edu Career Lab Hours The Career Lab offers on-demand reviews of resumes, cover letters, and LinkedIn profiles 12 – 4 pm weekdays.
