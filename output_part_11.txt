I've made some of the best connections during my time here — with friends, professors, coaches, staff, and alumni. Rachael Chen Basketball player; political science major Playing sports at Clark has helped me to grow both as a student and as a person. I have become more independent, self-reliant, and highly motivated. Olivia Barksdale Field hockey and softball player; environmental science major The concept of 'team' is important here, especially the way younger players learn from the older players. My Clark experience has been great, and I credit my team for that.

Guidelines for working with Employers Don’t cancel that class – we’ll cover your class time with a career-related workshop While creating your syllabi, you don’t need to cancel classes to work around your conference schedule. The Career Connections Center staff is excited to work with faculty and cover your class time with a career-related workshop. Possible topics include: “What can I do with a major in…” Applying to graduate school Internships Resumes Networking Job Search Cover Letters Interview Skills LinkedIn and Social Media Customize a Class The Career Connections Center can collaborate with you to co-teach or customize a class session. Examples of programs include: Online Tools and Career Resources for Specific Majors Museum Studies: How to Use Networking in Your Job Search Community Health: Making the Most of Your Internship in Community Health Political Science: Resumes and the Internship Search Process for Sophomores Career Center Synopsis: Ten-Minute Introduction of Services and Programs When to Request a Career Program We will do our best to meet all requests we receive within the following timelines: Customized Program: one month advance notice Pre-packaged workshop: two weeks notice Ten minute introduction: one week notice Faculty Request for Career Program To request a Career Program, please email cservices@clarku.edu with your contact information and some details about your class. Career and Major Exploration Encourage your students to reflect on their skills, interests, competencies, personality and values. We offer self-assessment tools, as well as information about competencies and career readiness (see below for more detail), including practical ways that students can strengthen workplace skills. Suggest Career Connections Center resources. Tools like What Can I Do with This Major? and other sites listed on our Explore page can be used to research career options for a variety of majors. Students can also schedule 1-on-1 appointments with career advisors and visit our daily drop-in hours. Debunk major and career myths. We believe that major does not determine or limit students’ career options. Unless a student is planning to enter a technical field, such as engineering or accounting, he/she can obtain the skills necessary to succeed through any of the 30+ majors offered at Clark. We encourage students to study what they enjoy, assess their values, interests, and personality, and explore careers related to what they have learned about themselves. We invite you to partner with us in encouraging this flexible career mindset. Competencies and Career Readiness Career readiness is more than a college degree or doing well in one’s major. The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) defines career readiness as “the attainment and demonstration of requisite competencies that broadly prepare college graduates for a successful transition into the workplace.” In other words, soft skills matter. Much has been written over the last few years about the fact that employers think students lack some of these important skills when they get to the workplace. NACE has identified eight competencies that students should be developing. The Career Connections Career Center works with students to help identify and build these competencies, so they are more fully prepared when they leave Clark. As faculty, you introduce and foster these competencies with Clark students throughout their years. Consider helping students more intentionally focus on competencies by explicitly linking them to class sessions/assignment/projects. Career-readiness competencies: Critical Thinking/Problem Solving Oral and Written Communication Civic Engagement (added by the Tufts Career Center based on additional research) Teamwork/Collaboration Digital Technology Global/Intercultural Fluency Leadership Professionalism/Work Ethic Career Management Networking Tips Encourage students to join ClarkCONNECT. By joining this virtual Clark community, students can find alumni mentors and request informational interviews from individuals whose career paths interest them. Remind students to attend networking events scheduled throughout the academic year. Students will find many networking opportunities, including Career Conversations, Industry Career Treks,, career fairs, Life After Clark Seminar and more on the Career Connections Center calendar. Share personal networking stories with your students. Networking is a skill developed with practice over time. Even so, we all know that connecting with an alumna/us can be an intimidating process, especially for novices, and your success stories will help demystify the process for students. Job and Internship Search Resources The Career Connections Center offers numerous resources for finding jobs and internships, including tools just for Clark students, field-specific career sites, and much more. In addition, we meet with students in 1-on-1 appointments and drop-in hours to discuss resumes and cover letters, internship and job search strategies, and more. Handshake is our online, mobile-friendly, recruiting platform that connects students and alumni to employers for jobs, internships and career events. Students can find postings for thousands of external jobs and internships, Clark on-campus student jobs, career resources, career events, fairs and announcements. ClarkCONNECT is our virtual Clark community where student can not only make alumni connections, they can find internships and jobs posted by or on behalf of alumni. Additional Job & Internship Resources Clark Destination Outcomes: See where students from your department go after graduation (including both employment and grad school data from recent grads) Suggest Career Connections Center resources on job & internship strategies that include how to guides and list of industry specific job boards. Students can also schedule 1-on-1 appointments with career advisors and visit our daily drop-in hours. Project, Internship and Research Funding: The Career Connections Center administers funds for 50-60 summer stipends for undergraduates who secured unpaid or low paying high impact opportunities. Advice for Recommendation Letters A letter of recommendation is “expert testimony” to a student’s ability to perform a task: contributing to a team project, succeeding in graduate school, or learning from a particular experience (such as foreign study/travel). You need to be confident of the applicant’s ability to be able to write convincingly. You could put your professional credibility at risk if you consistently write letters for applicants who are not qualified. For detailed information about the letter writing process, including sample recommendations, view this document (PDF). Recommendation Letters for Graduate School Applicants For graduate school, letter writers use these phrases at the beginning or end of the letter to express their professional evaluation. Generally speaking, there are four levels of confidence as suggested by graduate school forms themselves: Strongly recommend – You are very confident in the applicant’s ability Recommend – You are confident in applicant’s ability Recommend with reservations – You are somewhat confident, but have specific areas of doubt (include an explanation) Do not recommend – You do not believe in applicant’s ability to succeed (include an explanation) Tips for Successful Recommendation Letters A letter of recommendation succeeds on the same merits as any form of persuasive writing: good vocabulary, solid essay structure, appropriate content, and relevant details. Vocabulary – use strong, vivid language in both nouns and verbs. Essay Structure – Structure the letter as a four-to-five-paragraph essay with a thesis. The first paragraph should state how long writer has known applicant, in what context, and general “thesis” statement regarding applicant’s abilities/suitability for position. The main body should provide two or three examples or qualities that inspire confidence (or lack of confidence) in the applicant’s skills or character. Conclude with an explicit level of recommendation (strongly/highly, recommend, recommend with reservations [must provide explanation], do not recommend [must provide explanation]). Appropriate Content – Avoid exaggeration or speculation outside of your knowledge base. Details – Include a few well-chosen examples of why you recommend this individual. The examples should be obviously within your sphere of knowledge. Interfolio (letter of reference file service) Interfolio is an online credentials management service available to Clark students and alumni. It allows individuals to create and self-manage a portfolio of their credentials, including confidential and non-confidential letters of recommendation, writing samples and evaluations. For more information go here. Programming for Your Department (arranging guest speakers, alumni panels, career treks) If you are interested in holding an event for your students, the Career Connections Center can guide you toward a variety of options: Guest speaker – invite a guest speaker to your classroom to speak on a specific topic, the Career Center Alumni panel discussion – host a panel and the Career Connections Center can help you think through your plan, coordinate and advertise the event. Typical steps to planning a panel discussion: Determine the panel topic, related ClarkCONNECT community and format. Determine faculty and classes that will likely attend to ensure a bona fide audience and discussion. Set budget. Secure date, time, room, etc. Determine the appropriate number of panelists (we suggest securing 4-5 people to ensure 3-4). Determine the various perspectives on the topic you want represented on the panel. Solicit possible panelist names from other faculty members, students, advancement and the Career Connections Center. Send invitations to potential panelists well in advance of the event As alumni respond yes/no, determine who you’ll ask next to maintain a variety of perspectives on your panel Once panel is finalized, stay in touch with panelists. Write communication plan, including dates to send reminder emails Complete facilities requests and finalize logistical details. Write blurb for advertising. The Career Connections Center can publicize events in Handshake and through our social media channels. Career Treks – the Career Connections Center is looking for faculty partners for Career Discovery Treks. These off-campus employer visits allow students to gain insight into a variety of career fields in one trip. Treks are interactive field trips where students meet with alumni, learn what skills are needed in various industries, expand their professional networks, and increase their awareness of career possibilities. Contact Angela Harris, Associate Director of Employer Engagement, to learn more. Career Fairs, Events and Employer Engagement Each year, the Career Connections Center is involved with a significant number of career related events including everything from career fairs to LinkedIn workshops. Visit our calendar for upcoming events, including opportunities you may want to suggest to your students. Some of our signature events are: Fall Career Fair, Spring Career Fair Life After Clark Conference Career Discovery Treks How you can help your students? Announce Career Connections Center events in your classes and encourage all majors, all class years to attend relevant events. Help publicize events that are not an obvious match for your students, e.g., someone majoring in English can find a job in the life sciences industry. Offer extra credit for attending relevant events or make an assignment out of attending a Career Connections Center event once per semester. How you can partner with the Career Connections Center for events and employer engagement? Suggest alumni for the events. Recommend companies to invite to career fairs and/or to post jobs and internships in Handshake and ClarkCONNECT. Bring a Career Connections Center staff member with you if you’re planning an employer site visit. Attend employer events to hear more about what is going on in industry or to find partners for your research. Employment and Graduate School Outcomes: Where have your students landed? The Career Connections Center works diligently for comprehensive outcomes data each year. Help us track students We welcome your assistance in tracking first destinations for graduating seniors and internship data for current students. This information allows us to form strategic partnerships with sought-after employers as well as identify any employer engagement gaps. Better destination data also means that we’re able to engage in more productive career advising sessions with students who are eager to know where their peers have landed.

Submit Search Query Enter a search query. Submit Search Query Why Clark Recruiting at Clark Recruiting Policies Why Clark Recruiting at Clark Recruiting Policies Recruiting Policies Home Recruiting Policies Clark University invites organizational representatives to post opportunities for students through Handshake and to send recruiting inquiries and schedule events through one of our Career Centers. You can find contact information to reach our different career centers here or email your inquiry to our Office of Employer Engagement at cservices@clarku.edu. Clark University’s Career Centers require that employers read and abide by the following policies below. As individual members of the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), each Career Center adheres to the NACE Principles for Career Services and Employment Professionals and expects recruiters who partner with us to review and follow all NACE Principles. Statement of Non-Discrimination Clark University’s Career Centers make their services available to employers who do not unlawfully discriminate in the selection of employees on the basis of national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, disability, or any other basis prohibited by applicable law. Employers who engage in any recruiting activities including but not limited to, posting positions, attending career fairs, hosting information sessions, participating in on-campus interviewing, or engaging in another specialized program, must adhere to Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) guidelines. Policies Guidelines for job, internship, volunteer and research postings Clark University uses Handshake, a web-based platform for posting all full time, part-time, internship, research, and on-campus positions at Clark University. All recruiting organizations or individuals are expected to accurately describe their organizations, positions, and position requirements when posting their information on Handshake. Our Career Centers will approve or decline your connection or postings within one week and will reply to you with any concerns or questions within the Handshake platform. To learn more about Handshake and for information on creating an account, please refer to the “off-campus employers’ section of our Handshake FAQs page. To be approved to post in Handshake with Clark University, we require (at a minimum): A completed employer profile, including a fully functioning website, and a brief description of the company. A complete physical office address and telephone number. All contacts’ email domains must match the website domain. Postings must be actual, current openings for internships, research opportunities,volunteer work, and/or traditional, W-2 or 1099 full- or part-time employees. Postings must contain sufficient detail to convey clearly to the user the nature and basic requirements of theopportunity. Positions & practices that will not be posted or supported: Positions or programs that charge a fee for participation or require an initial investment from students including but not limited to, donations, application fees, require participation in unpaid training, require the purchase of kits or other work–related materials, or offering items or services for sale cannot be advertised on Handshake. Opportunities that involve on-campus solicitation, posting of materials, or sale of products or services. Organizations sponsoring an individual to establish their own business for the purpose of selling products or services, and/or recruiting other individuals to establish their own businesses. Work in home–based businesses and private homes such as child care, tutoring, nanny, moving, maintenance, etc. Positions that pay for work in cash or other informal work/pay arrangements. Positions that require students to solicit money or sell items to students on campus as “campus ambassadors” or “student campus recruiters.” Commission based employers Commission sales positions may be advertised to students and alumni on Handshake provided that the compensation arrangement is clearly noted on job listings. Employers who compensate employees based solely on commissions (i.e. without a base salary as well) must clearly disclose this information in the job description. Employers who compensate employees based on partial commissions must disclose accurate estimates of expected earnings in their job descriptions. They must also present an accurate base salary/expected first-year salary at that time. Employers from the cannabis industry Clark University is aware of the growing industry surrounding the sale of legal marijuana in Massachusetts and the industry’s interest in cultivating talent for this emerging field. While cannabis is legal in Massachusetts, it remains illegal on a federal level, and thus provides a conflict for the University when considering the employers recruiting on campus and the career-related opportunities off-campus within this industry. The federal Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act disallows the unlawful possession, use, and distribution of illicit drugs, including marijuana. If the university fails to comply, it could become ineligible for federal funding, including financial aid programs for students. For that reason, Clark University is unable to approve employers or job postings involved with the development, production, testing, distribution, or use of recreational or medical marijuana. Student ambassadors Clark prohibits employers from hiring students to solicit money or sell items to students on campus as “campus ambassadors” or “student campus recruiters.” Clark does not send resumes or give any employer passwords to “student ambassadors” or “student campus recruiters.” It is a violation of professional standards to provide a student’s resume to a fellow student for review and decision-making. Third-party representatives To participate in recruiting activities with Clark University, all third-party recruiting organizations must agree to the criteria outlined below. A third-party recruiter is defined as an individual, agency or organization that recruits candidates for temporary, part-time or full-time employment opportunities for another organization, in accordance with the NACE (National Association of Colleges & Employers) definition. Third-party recruiters may post their positions on Handshake. They will be required to verify in advance whether they are recruiting for their own organizations or for their clients. Third-party firms who are recruiting for positions within their own organizations must clearly differentiate those opportunities from their client engagements. To source and identify recent graduates and alumni, third-party recruiters agree to: Identify themselves as a third-party recruiter in their employer profile on Handshake and all client job announcements. Provide accurate, “real-time” position descriptions and identify on all job announcements, including on Handshake, the name of the employer being represented, and the location of the position. The Career Centers reserve the right to investigate and ask for information regarding client organizations. Verify that no fees of any kind will be charged to student or alumni applicants by the recruiting agency and by the client; Not disclose to any employer, including the client-employer, any student information without obtaining prior written consent from the student. Under no circumstances can student information be disclosed other than for the original recruiting purposes nor can it be sold or provided to other entities Not prohibit, restrict or penalize applicants from accepting a job directly with a client company. Career fairs and on-campus recruiting The Career Centers invite organizations who are actively recruiting for paid full-time or paid structured internship opportunities to participate in on-campus recruiting events. Third-party recruiters, graduate school programs, organizations offering unpaid internships and service/volunteer opportunities will be considered on a case by case basis provided the opportunities offered are structured and provide an experiential learning opportunity. Positions that are solely based on commission with no base pay will not be included in on-campus recruiting events. Confidentiality policy Employment professionals will maintain the confidentiality of student information, regardless of the source, including personal knowledge, written records/reports, and computer databases. There will be no disclosure of student information to another organization without the prior written consent of the student, unless necessitated by health and/or safety considerations. Alcohol Serving alcohol should not be part of the recruitment process on or off campus. This includes receptions, dinners, company tours, etc. Offers to students Employment professionals will refrain from any practice that improperly influences and affects acceptances. Such practices may include undue time pressure for acceptance of offers and encouragement of revocation of another offer. Employment professionals will strive to communicate decisions to candidates within the agreed-upon time frame. Interview rounds When asking students to come back for second/final round interviews, employers must attempt to accommodate students’ schedules and allow reasonable time if their schedules need to be adjusted. Timely communication Employers are expected to keep students informed of their status in the hiring process and to communicate hiring decisions within a reasonable time frame. Deferred, rescinded, or withdrawn offers Withdrawing job offers, whether verbal or written, violates professional standards and may put students in a difficult professional and financial position. If your organization is considering retracting an offer for any reason, please call our office immediately to discuss the situation. Disclaimer The Career Centers of Clark University reserve the right, in their sole discretion, to deny any employer or recruiter access to the services offered by the Career Centers for any reason. Best practices Best practices for Handshake postings Tips to get the most out of your opportunity posting experience are: Be very specific with job details and requirements. Make sure to enter in as much information as you can (location, pay rate, etc.). Select the grade levels that are eligible for the position so that qualified applicants apply to the position. Posting is for one position only, not multiple positions. All of the included links are functioning. Best practices for inclusive postings When setting job and applicant preferences on your postings, we encourage you to consider only selecting the essential qualifications. Students from non-traditional backgrounds might view a long list of qualifications unrelated to skills and traits, such as student minimum GPA or major specifications, as barriers to applying. Indicate whether your organization is accepting OPT/CPT candidates for internships or is willing to sponsor candidates for full-time opportunities. Selecting work authorization specifications that align with your organization’s policies ensures that you are receiving applications from international student talent. Use inclusive language in your postings that candidates from all backgrounds can identify with. For example, remove gender-coded words like “hackers” or “ninja” and avoid using unnecessary jargon, acronyms, or corporate-speak like “KPI’S” and “P&L” in entry-level opportunities to limit entry-level candidates from feeling unqualified. Definitions of positions Unpaid interns in the for-profit private sector Unpaid internships posted in the Clark Recruiter must follow the “primary beneficiary test” established in The Fair Labor Standards Act. According to the Department of Labor, an unpaid internship must meet all these criteria: Both the intern and the employer clearly understand it’s an unpaid position The internship provides training similar to that which would be given in an educational environment The internship is tied to the intern’s education via integrated coursework or academic internship credit The internship corresponds to the academic calendar The internship provides beneficial learning for the duration of the internship The intern doesn’t displace paid employees The intern isn’t promised a job at the conclusion of the internship Unpaid interns in a nonprofit organization The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) recognizes an exception to the above requirements for individuals who volunteer their time, freely and without anticipation of compensation for religious, charitable, civic, or humanitarian purposes to non-profit organizations. Unpaid internships in the public sector and for non-profit charitable organizations, where the intern volunteers without expectation of compensation, are generally permissible. The wage and hour division (WHD) is reviewing the need for additional guidance on internships in the public and non-profit sectors. Volunteer To determine whether an individual is a true volunteer engaged in “ordinary volunteerism,” the Department of Labor considers a number of factors. No single factor is determinative. The factors include:Is the entity that will benefit/receive services from the volunteer a nonprofit organization?Is the activity less than a full-time occupation?Are the services offered freely and without pressure or coercion?Are the services of the kind typically associated with volunteer work?Have regular employees been displaced to accommodate the volunteer?Does the worker receive (or expect) any benefit from the entity to which it is providing services?A volunteer position at your nonprofit is likely to be regarded as “ordinary volunteerism” and safely exempt from the minimum wage requirements of the FLSA if you can answer “yes” to the first four questions and “no” to the final two questions. Foreign students as trainees and volunteers Many international students look for unpaid internships and volunteer opportunities.

As someone who has been deeply involved with Clark’s international and community development programs for almost 30 years, I am very proud and excited about the Department of Sustainability and Social Justice, an evolution of what we formerly referred to as IDCE (International Development, Community, and Environment). Through our practice, research, community engagement, and scholarship, we are called to focus on the critical, interconnected issues facing our world today: climate change adaptation; forced migration; gender, racial, and economic equality; and equitable access to high-quality and culturally responsive food, health, education, and housing. We offer immersive experiences for our students to apply what they learn; these include Global Learning Collaboratives, which allow them to pursue experiential learning opportunities from Worcester to Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Today, our department is deepening and amplifying what we have always done best: provide opportunities for students to work with faculty and to partner with communities on projects that matter. Our engagement — which challenges the false dichotomies of global and local, rural and urban — is rooted in participatory and liberatory methods of knowledge production and action. This calls us to understand the world as interrelated and interconnected, and opens space for communities to determine their destinies. As an undergraduate and graduate student in our programs during the 1980s and ’90s, I had the opportunity to study abroad in Central America, conduct research in the Dominican Republic with Geography Professor Dianne Rocheleau, and apply the participatory and collaborative approaches I learned from International Development Professor Richard “Dick” Ford. Once back in Worcester, I became deeply involved in neighborhood and community development efforts and, with the support of Professor Ford, I applied that same methodology to engage youth to reimagine their neighborhood and redesign an underused city park. That experience led to our launching the Community Development and Planning Program, which still is committed, as I am, to supporting youth and neighborhood efforts in Worcester. All of us in the Department of Sustainability and Social Justice share this unwavering commitment to making the world more just and sustainable. Today, our mission is more important than ever: to understand the complexity of urgent social, political, and ecological problems and develop leaders who, through collaborative scholarship and innovation, are prepared to find solutions to these challenges. I welcome you to join us in this new and exciting venture.

Through long-term research collaborations and partnerships with practitioners, policymakers, and community members most impacted by these challenges, we develop strategies and policies that direct attention and resources toward equitable and sustainable solutions. Climate change impacts and adaptation All people and places are touched by climate change — but impacts and capacities to adapt are unevenly distributed across populations and landscapes, making social equity and justice core concerns. Our collaborative, integrative research and practice draw from the work of environmental, social, and policy sciences to strengthen society’s capacity to understand and address the climate crisis — charting a socially just, sustainable, climate-responsive future. Education, youth, and development Education and youth development are dynamic processes that extend beyond formal institutions such as schools, and include informal community spaces and youth development organizations. Our commitment to transformative education and youth development is rooted in a global and social justice perspective, emphasizing a critical analysis of power and privilege. At the intersection of educational access, justice, and equity, our work extends to crucial aspects of identity such as gender, race, religion, ethnicity, and class. Through collaborative scholarship and practice, we aspire to create environments that empower young people to navigate, question, and shape the world around them, ultimately contributing to a more just society. Global health and health equity We adopt a holistic perspective on health that extends beyond the narrow confines of physical well-being to encompass the mental, spiritual, social, and environmental dimensions. Health is linked to a complex interplay among socio-economic, cultural, political, and environmental conditions. In our research and practice, we are committed to the overarching goal of achieving health equity and justice on a global scale. This commitment requires that we challenge gender, class, and generational hierarchies that shape individuals’ access to resources, opportunities, and health outcomes. Our comprehensive orientation to health research and practice informs strategies that promote inclusivity and foster positive change. Refugees, forced migration, and human rights Changing climate patterns are creating a rise in forced migration, geopolitical competition, and conflict-induced displacement. Human societies will need to find mutually sustaining ways to integrate communities together with displaced persons, assess human rights abuses, and plan for humanitarian action. Sustainable food systems Food is a fundamental human right and central to sustainable, equitable, and just community development. Despite rapid advances in agricultural science and technology, millions of people around the world continue to experience malnourishment and extreme hunger. Human and planetary well-being is not possible unless communities everywhere have equal access to safe, nutritious, sufficient, and culturally meaningful food. Multiple forms of knowledge and expertise are needed to address this complex problem. Researchers and practitioners at SSJ are helping to improve urban food systems in the city of Worcester, agricultural resilience in Puerto Rico, and exploring the ways Indigenous and other place-based ecological knowledge can enable communities in Ethiopia to enhance food security and anticipate and adapt to change.

Read Full Story Make an Impact on Climate Change, Sustainable Development, and Social Justice. Join us on the project “Co-Creating Capacities to Understand, Visualize, and Mitigate Climate-Change Impact Cascades and Inequities in Central Mexico,” in partnership with the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), funded by the National Science Foundation. Earn your master’s degree from globally ranked and recognized Clark University. Join our interdisciplinary team of faculty and graduate students as a member of the second research cohort and collaborate with the first cohort for transformative team-based work. Project Background and Details In 2022, “Co-Creating Capacities to Understand, Visualize, and Mitigate Climate-Change Impact Cascades and Inequities in Central Mexico” was awarded a $1.5 million grant from the National Science Foundation’s Partnerships for International Research and Education (PIRE) program (award #2230723). The project involves nine Clark faculty from the Department of Sustainability and Social Justice, Graduate School of Geography, and Becker School of Design & Technology (BSDT). Our partners in Mexico include faculty from the National Autonomous University of Mexico’s (UNAM) Laboratory for Sustainability Sciences (LANCIS), Institute of Atmospheric Sciences & Climate Change (ICAyCC), and Program for Climate Change Research (PINCC), as well as the Mexico City government and local communities. The project co-creates and integrates four components: A regional climate-change atlas using web-based GIS to map and spatially analyze climate, water, food/agriculture, ecosystem, health, and livelihood conditions A system dynamics model (SDM) to represent interactions among these sectors, impact cascades (one sector’s impacts propagate through others), the unevenness of impacts across populations/landscapes, and the simulation of alternative futures An eXtended Reality (XR) platform that allows stakeholders to inhabit those futures virtually to chart sustainable, socially just, climate-resilient pathways A research/practice-based suite of courses that Clark and UNAM students take together — including field research with local community partners Interdisciplinary stakeholder co-creation is central to the work. Cohorts of Clark students spend months in the field, living and working with community partners and UNAM peers, which results in a transformative team-based experience. Choice of Degree Paths Five experiential learning opportunities are available, aligned with five of our highly regarded master’s degree programs: M.S. in Environmental Science & Policy: Co-create knowledge and decision-making capacities with partners from local communities and the Mexico City government. M.S. in Geographic Information Science: Develop and pilot a regional climate-change atlas, co-created and co-owned by our community and government partners. M.A. in International Development: Be part of a social-technical enterprise that represents a new co-creation paradigm for sustainable development work.

Ramón Borges-Méndez at work in Puerto Rico Collaborating with island and mainland community development corporations, private and nonprofit financial intermediaries, investors, and housing professionals, researchers will guide the design and creation of the Puerto Rico Community Predevelopment Fund (PRPDF), which will support affordable housing and other local economic development projects. PRPDF will provide high-risk predevelopment loans, grants, and equity investments to CDCs promoting housing reconstruction, rehabilitation, and construction, as well as commercial development in downtown districts. The fund will also cover predevelopment costs such as architectural fees, environmental mitigation, acquisition, legal, and other consulting fees. Borges-Méndez will bring this project into the classroom by integrating lessons into his Community Development and Planning graduate courses and the courses he teaches in Puerto Rico.

The goal is to build interest in community development and encourage the next generation of affordable housing practitioners. The competition connects graduate students with developers and experts in the fields of community development finance, architectural design, and community engagement to create affordable housing proposals. The students also received support from the Community Economic Development Assistance Corporation’s Director of Housing for Central and Western Massachusetts. View ClarkNow Story “A lot of people think an affordable housing structure will be a big, ugly eyesore. It doesn’t have to be that way. Everyone deserves to live somewhere beautiful and spacious.” —Wynne Plagge ’22, M.A. ’23 Collaborative for Youth and Community Justice The Collaborative for Youth and Community Justice (CYCJ) works with community partners to conduct action research on how best to meet community needs and assess the effectiveness of programs; provide professional education and training to youth and community outreach workers, emphasizing trauma-informed practices; facilitate dialogues to help amplify youth and community voices and increase collaborations among community groups; and engage in community capacity building through collaborative strategic planning. CYCJ participates in several action research projects, including the Worcester Youth Violence Prevention Initiative, Worcester ACTS, and the Youth Worker Training Institute. Professor Laurie Ross (left) and Professor Jennifer Safford congratulate a Youth Worker Training Institute graduate. The Youth Worker Training Institute emerged from a need for better education for people working with young people in Worcester. Members of the Collaborative for Youth and Community Justice led the evaluation of all youth-serving organizations and found a serious need for professionalizing youth workers. Clark University, the HOPE Coalition, and the CYCJ collaborate to conduct the annual Youth Worker Training Institute. The Institute is a 15-week comprehensive and meaningful professional development opportunity for youth workers. Staff gain knowledge about positive youth development, build skills in program planning and implementation, learn more about the roles and responsibilities of youth workers, and develop a common understanding of youth development approaches and local resources. The Institute creates a path to earn a Certificate in Youth Work Practice at Clark University, and each session includes networking and resource-sharing.
