r change the length of your employment period. You may only work for the employer specified in the CPT authorization section on page two of the Form I-20, and you must not begin work until you have received the CPT authorization from the ISSO. Working on dates that are not included in the CPT authorization or working before your CPT has been authorized is not permitted and may result in the termination of your F-1 status. Allow five business days from the time we receive your CPT application and documents in the ISSO Portal to issue your new I-20 with CPT authorization. Undergraduate Students For undergraduates, all internships must be part of your essential academic program. If the internship is not already part of a class, you must apply to receive academic credit for the internship. Follow these steps: After securing the internship, find a full-time faculty member to act as your faculty sponsor for your academic internship. You and your faculty sponsor will plan the academic portion of your academic internship (see this page for more information). Apply to the Academic Internship Program through the Career Connections Center. Apply at least 10 days in advance of your internship start date. Once you receive approval from the Career Connections Center for your academic internship, apply through the ISSO Portal to receive CPT from the ISSO. Please note: do this as soon as you receive your academic internship approval to allow enough time to process your application. Wait to receive your I-20 before starting your internship. The ISSO cannot backdate CPT applications. You are not legally allowed to work in the United States until you’ve received your I-20 with CPT work authorization. School of Professional Studies Students All SPS graduate students must complete an internship to graduate; required internships are not eligible for academic credit. For more information on the SPS Internship Approval Process, please reach out to SPS directly. Once you receive approval for your internship, apply for CPT through the ISSO portal. Wait to receive your I-20 before starting your internship. The ISSO cannot backdate CPT applications.

All Other Graduate Students To obtain approval for CPT, apply through the ISSO Portal. Regardless of your program of study, please allow five business days after you have submitted your documents to the ISSO for processing of your new I-20. Working prior to receiving authorization from the ISSO (new I-20 with CPT authorization) can have negative consequences on your immigration status. For more details on Curricular Practical Training, please contact the ISSO directly. Optional Practical Training (OPT) Optional Practical Training (OPT) is temporary employment that is directly related to the student’s major area of study. A student must apply to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) for OPT employment authorization. You are eligible for a total of 12 months of OPT per program level. Before you can apply, you must have been enrolled on a full-time basis for at least two consecutive semesters/one academic year. To be considered full-time, you must be enrolled in at least three units of credit. Types of OPT Pre-Completion OPT Pre-completion OPT takes place before you complete your degree program. This may be an option if you wish to pursue a work experience that does not qualify for CPT authorization. Pre-completion OPT is limited to no more than 20 hours per week while you are enrolled full-time and classes are in session. You may work full-time when school is not in session. The U.S. government may take up to 90 to 150 days to approve pre-completion OPT. The ISSO strongly recommends that you apply as soon as you know you will have a job. Pre-completion OPT counts as part of the total 12 months of OPT allowed. Part-time pre-completion OPT subtracts from the 12 months at one-half (1/2) the rate. (Four months of part-time pre-completion OPT would reduce your post-completion OPT by two months.) An application for pre-completion OPT is for a specific period of time prior to completing your program. It requires a complete Application for Employment Authorization, including the filing fee. The application is sent to the U.S. government for processing. Post-Completion OPT This is the most common type of OPT. It allows students to work off campus to get experience in their field of study after graduation. Post-completion OPT is always full-time, which means working more than 20 hours per week. You apply to the U.S. government for work authorization. Post-completion OPT must directly relate to your field of study that is listed on your I-20. When to apply Pre-Completion OPT You can apply after you’ve been enrolled full-time for at least one academic year. Apply up to 90 days before you want work authorization to begin. Post-Completion OPT You can apply up to 90 days before your program end date, and up to 60 days after your program end date. OPT applications are generally processed within 60 to 100 days (including mailing time), so we highly recommend applying early so that you will be able to start working when you want to after your program end date. How to Apply Attend an OPT Workshop. This is mandatory and must be done before the ISSO will request your I-20 with OPT dates. Apply for graduation at the Registrar’s Office. Ph.D. students only: Obtain a letter from your academic adviser that confirms the date that your degree requirements will be met (dissertation defense or dissertation submission date). Submit a request for Optional Practical Training through the ISSO Portal. Once submitted, you will receive further instructions on the process. Additional Considerations Requirements While on OPT You must be engaged in practical training (working) at a job that is directly related to your field of study. Your total working hours must be more than 20 hours per week. You must report any changes of address or employment to SEVP using the SEVP Portal within 10 days of any change. Keep proof of your employment for your records. Limit time that you are unemployed to 90 days or less during your OPT. Unemployment days accrue throughout the 12 months of your OPT. Travel While on OPT Unless international travel is absolutely necessary, we advise that you remain in the United States while your OPT application is pending. Once your OPT is approved, you should carry with you the following documents when you travel: Valid passport Valid F-1 visa Printout of your most recent I-94 information I-20 with OPT endorsement and travel signature that is signed within the past six months on P. 2. Employment Authorization Document (EAD card) Proof of employment (job offer letter, employment contract, etc.) Travel while on OPT is riskier if you do not have proof of employment, as Customs and Border Protection officers at the Port of Entry may refuse your entry into the United States. If you need to get a new F-1 visa while on OPT, please contact the ISSO prior to leaving the U.S. to make sure that you are prepared for your visa interview. If you have questions about traveling while on OPT, please contact the ISSO. Receiving a Request for Evidence (RFE) If USCIS determines that something in your application requires further clarification they will send you a Request for Evidence (RFE). If you receive an RFE, you are required to respond by the deadline listed on the notification. You will also need to submit a copy of the RFE to the ISSO through the Request for Evidence (RFE) Upload request in the ISSO Portal. Once you have submitted your Request for Evidence (RFE) Upload request to the ISSO Portal, A team member will review your RFE and inform you of next steps. If it is determined that no evidence is needed from ISSO or from another Campus Partner, you will receive an email with suggestions about who can provide the requested evidence. If it is determined you need documentation from ISSO or from another Campus Partner you will receive an email stating what additional documentation will be provided. As the ISSO strongly advises you to consult with an immigration attorney for an RFE, the ISSO will also share immigration attorney resources with you. RFE Review Process All RFEs are unique, therefore, all supporting letters and documents are drafted based on the specific request of the RFE. The ISSO may have multiple RFE being reviewed simultaneously, therefore, processing times for RFEs vary based on: The complexity of the RFE and number of required supporting documents The number of Campus Partners that are asked to provide supporting documentation The due date of the RFE The typical timeline to receive your RFE materials is 10-15 Business days. Keep in mind this is an estimate, if the RFE is complex, it may lengthen the period of time it take to prepare the materials. Once your materials have been completed, they will be uploaded to the document section of your ISSO Portal and you will be sent an email. Be sure to check your immigration document for any errors or missing information. It is your responsibility to ensure your immigration documents and supportive evidence are correct and complete before submitting them to USCIS. Please contact our office at isso@clarku.edu if you feel that your immigration documents or supportive evidence are incorrect. Clark University and the ISSO can never guarantee OPT or STEM OPT Approval. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) ultimately provides the decision on your application. It is your responsibility, as the applicant, to ensure that your application and supportive materials are accurate and complete before you submit it to the US government. Incomplete applications could result in a delay in processing time or denial. Clark University in no event shall be held liable for any delay, denial, or mistake on your OPT or STEM OPT application. After Your OPT When Your OPT Ends When your OPT ends, you will have several options for what to do next: You will be automatically granted a 60-day grace period that will begin the day after your OPT ends. You may not work or study during your grace period, and you may not re-enter the United States in F-1 status during this time. You must do one of the things listed below before or during your grace period in order to maintain your immigration status. You may depart the United States. If you leave after your OPT ends, you will not be able to come back in F-1 status with your documents from Clark. You can enroll in another degree program at Clark or another U.S. university. Contact the ISSO for more information about what is required in this case. You can change to another immigration status by requesting the change of status from the U.S. government. Many students are interested in the H-1B visa, which is a visa based on employment and is sponsored by the student’s employer. Learn more about the H-1B visa on the USCIS website. STEM OPT Extension Students in certain STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) fields may apply for a 24-month extension of their OPT if their employment meets certain qualifications. Who qualifies? A student who received a degree from an accredited U.S. institution in a major that is on the STEM Designated Degree Programs List. The six-digit code associated with the major listed on your I-20 must be on this list for you to qualify. The full list is available on the Student and Exchange Visitor Program website. A student who is in a valid period of post-completion OPT and has maintained their status while on OPT. A student who has previously earned a STEM degree in the United States from an accredited U.S. higher education institution can apply if the previous degree was earned from an SEVP-certified institution within the past 10 years, the qualifying employment is directly related to the STEM degree, and all of the above criteria are met. Students can apply for a STEM OPT extension twice per lifetime. How to apply? The student must apply for the STEM OPT extension before the current post-completion OPT period ends. Applications can be submitted up to 90 days before the OPT end date. Submit a request for STEM OPT Extension through the ISSO Portal, including Form I-983 with your employer.

J-1 Students J-1 students are permitted to work in the U.S. only if they are maintaining valid J-1 status and have the written permission of their J-1 sponsor. There are two different types of employment for J-1 students: Employment Academic Training For information about each type of employment and the procedures for obtaining authorization, see the sections below. Please note: If you are a J-1 student and your J-1 sponsor is an external organization instead of Clark University (e.g., Fullbright/IIE), your sponsor must directly authorize you for employment and assist you with obtaining documents needed for Social Security applications. Please contact your sponsor for their directions/instructions. Employment Student employment is permitted only while you are pursuing your J-1 program objective. There are three types of student employment: Employment based on a fellowship, assistantship, or grant (such as a teaching or research assistantship). Employment that takes place on the premises of the campus (on-campus employment). On-campus employment may be with any Clark department or office but cannot be any job that requires U.S. federal work study (FWS) financial aid approval as a condition of employment. Off-campus employment authorized due to serious, urgent, and unforeseen economic circumstance. Eligibility and Restrictions To qualify for J-1 student employment, you must be in good academic standing. You must continue to pursue a full course of study while engaged in employment. You can be authorized for more than one type of employment at the same time, but you cannot work more than 20 hours per week while school is in session; full-time (over 20 hours per week) is permitted during summer vacations. Authorizations are granted for up to one year at a time or until the end of your J-1 program, whichever comes first. You must submit a new request if your employment will extend beyond one year. Requesting J-1 Student Employment Authorization Employment for Fellowship/Assistantships or On-Campus Jobs Please submit an On-Campus Employment (J) Request in the ISSO Portal prior to beginning your job. You will be asked to upload an Employment Letter, issued on University letterhead by the on-campus office or department. The ISSO will review your request, and if approved, enter the employment information in SEVIS. Please visit the Student Employment page, and under “Students Who Have Not Yet Worked on Campus” click on the Student Employment Verification Policy link to review the application process in full. Employment for J-1 Severe Economic Hardship If you are experiencing severe economic hardship due to unforeseen circumstances, you must meet with an ISSO adviser to discuss your specific situation. Severe economic hardship may be the result of unforeseen events such as unexpected medical expenses, financial hardship experienced by your J-1 funding sponsor, economic crises in your home country, or similar situations. You must be able to provide documentation of the change in your financial situation. This type of employment authorization, if approved, allows you to work off-campus up to 20 hours per week while school is in session (or over 20 hours per week during summer vacations), in any job that will help you with your financial needs. Authorizations are granted up to one year or until the end of your J-1 program, whichever comes first. You must have authorization from the ISSO before beginning employment. Academic Training Academic training is designed to provide J-1 visa holders with employment experience to complement their program of study in the United States. Work must be directly related to your field of study, and it must be appropriate for someone with your level of education. You may engage in academic training during your degree program and/or after the completion of your degree program as long as the total amount of training does not exceed the prescribed time limitations indicated below. Eligibility A J-1 student is eligible for academic training if they are: In good standing or have successfully completed a program of study. Participating in academic training that is directly related to his or her major field of study. Authorized in advance to engage in academic training with written approval of the International Students and Scholars Office. Time Limitations For undergraduate and predoctoral students, up to 18 months of academic training may be authorized; however, academic training cannot exceed the length of your program of study. Students obtaining a doctoral degree may be eligible for 36 months of academic training. Academic training must begin within 30 days of program completion. How to Apply for Academic Training Please submit an Academic Training (J-1) request in the ISSO Portal. You will need to upload your employment letter and obtain approval from your academic department through submitting a recommendation request in the Portal. If your Academic Training will occur after completion of your degree program, your DS-2019 will be extended and you will need proof of financial resources adequate to support yourself during your Academic Training. The ISSO will review your request and update you SEVIS record and DS-2019 with the approved Academic Training and program extension and change in financial information (if needed). Additional Employment Topics Entrepreneurial Activities Clark offers a growing range of programs and courses focusing on entrepreneurship. However, international students are advised to proceed with caution when considering participation in certain entrepreneurial activities. International students are limited by F-1 and J-1 employment regulations in actually operating a business in the United States. Employment, including self-employment, without proper authorization is a serious violation of lawful immigration status. It is not always clear what activities are considered employment in the U.S. and therefore require authorization. The ISSO strongly encourages students to seek independent legal advice from a licensed immigration attorney before engaging in activities that may be considered employment. Students may email the ISSO to request a list of immigration attorneys. The normal pathways to employment authorization for F-1 and J-1 students offer limited options for self-employment. Consult the ISSO for more information. F-1 Optional Practical Training (OPT): Immigration regulations permit self-employment. F-1 STEM OPT Extension: Self-employment not permitted. A “bona fide” employee-employer relationship must exist F-1 Curricular Practical Training (CPT): Self-employment is not permitted; a clear employer-employee relationship must exist. J-1 Academic Training: Self-employment is not permitted; a clear employer-employee relationship must exist. Employer-Employee Relationship With the exception of Optional Practical Training, self-employment is not permitted by the employment authorization regulations for international students. An employer-employee relationship is defined differently in many states, but generally the Federal Government looks at the employer’s ability to hire, pay, fire, supervise, or otherwise control the work of the employee when defining an employer-employee relationship. Starting a Business International students may be interested in starting a business while they are student. However, the ISSO cautions students to investigate each opportunity carefully as many of the activities involved in starting a business may be considered employment, which must be authorized in advance. Developing or providing products or services without authorization is a violation of your immigration status. Consult a licensed immigration attorney for more information. Passive Income versus Active Income International students must not be actively involved in making money in any way in the United States without prior authorization through Optional Practical Training (OPT), curricular practical training (CPT), Academic Training (AT) or student employment. Active income is considered employment, which must be authorized. However, certain passive income generating activities may be permissible as long as no employment is taking place. Consult a licensed immigration attorney for more information. Volunteering in the US International students may be interested in volunteering (conducting work without pay) for an organization in the US. Students must confirm that any volunteer opportunity is truly voluntary, and would not be considered unauthorized employment. Students may generally volunteer for a public agency for civic, charitable, or humanitarian purposes. Refer questions regarding volunteer opportunities to the ISSO or a licensed immigration attorney. Please note, these directions/resources are meant to help you but should not be considered legal advice. Clark University in no event shall be held liable for any employment violations.

If you do not have a Clark-sponsored visa, you must request your travel signature from your program sponsor. For more information about travel, visit the Department of Homeland Security’s Study in the States page. Travel signatures are generally valid for one year or until the program end date on your I-20 or Form DS-2019, whichever comes first. However, the ISSO recommends getting a travel signature every six months. Travel signatures are valid for six months for students on Post-Completion OPT and STEM OPT Extension. You are not required to have a travel signature to depart the United States; travel signatures are only required for you to re-enter the U.S. to continue your studies, Academic Training period, or OPT period. Note: You must be maintaining your F-1 or J-1 status. You do not qualify for a travel signature on your I-20 or Form DS-2019 if: Your I-20 is in Initial, Transfer, or Change of Education Level status.

Travel to Canada, Mexico, or the Caribbean on an Expired Visa If you are traveling to any other country, it is important for you to determine whether you need a visa to enter that country. Visit that country’s embassy website for information. You may be allowed to exit and return to the United States with an expired visa if you travel to Canada, Mexico, or the Caribbean. To meet the qualifications for “automatic revalidation,” your travel must meet the following requirements: You are traveling directly to and from Canada, Mexico, or the adjacent Islands. Your trip is 30 days or less. You have a non-immigrant U.S. visa (even if expired). You hold a valid I-94 that indicates your current non-immigrant status. The purpose of your travel was NOT to apply for a new F-1, J-1, or H1-B visa at a United States consulate in one of those locations. To return to the U.S., you must also have a valid I-20 or DS-2019 with travel signature, or an I-797 approval notice showing you have been approved for H1-B status. It is recommended that you consult with the ISSO before attempting to re-enter the U.S. with an expired visa from Canada, Mexico, or the Caribbean. Visa Renewal If you currently hold non-immigrant status at Clark such as F-1 student, J-1 scholar, or H1-B employee, you must have an unexpired U.S. visa (F, J, or H) in order to enter the United States. If your current F, J, or H visa will or has expired, you must get a new visa (F, J, or H) if you are outside the United States and want to return to Clark to continue your studies or employment at the University. Note: If you are a Canadian citizen, you generally do not need a visa in your passport to enter the United States. Frequently Asked Questions Where can I apply for my new visa? Visas are only issued at U.S. consulates or embassies outside of the United States. You need a visa if you are outside of the U.S. and intend to enter or re-enter the U.S. to start or continue your employment or studies at Clark. You CANNOT apply for a visa from within the United States. Each U.S. consulate or embassy has its own processes and procedures. Check with the U.S. consulate or embassy near where you will apply to learn more from them. Usually, you will need to apply for a new visa at a U.S. consulate or embassy in your country of citizenship or permanent residence. Questions about how to apply for a visa should be directed to the consulate or embassy where you are applying for your non-immigrant visa. How do I apply for my visa? Please visit Clark’s resource on “Applying for a Visa.” Helpful information about the process and rules for studying in the United States as an international student can be found on Study in the States. I am a student enrolled at Clark or on Post-Completion OPT and my visa has expired, does that mean I have to leave the United States? No, you do not need to leave the U.S. F-1 and J-1 students are admitted to the United States for Duration of Status. This means that you can remain in the United States as long as you have a valid Form I-20 or DS-2019 and are maintaining your nonimmigrant status. My visa is expiring next week, can I still use it to enter the U.S.? As long as the expiration date on your visa has not passed and your visa has not been canceled, you may use it to enter the United States. Keep in mind that you must enter the U.S. using a visa consistent with your purpose for entering the U.S. For example, if you have an F-1 student visa and you want to use your F-1 visa to enter the U.S. to continue your studies or OPT experience, you can use your visa. Express Mail for Documents The International Center uses UEMS eShipGlobal for all domestic and international mail requests. eShipGlobal is a university shipping company that assists international scholars and students send and receive important documents such as I-20s, DS-2019s, and OPT applications. To use eShipGlobal: Go to the eShipGlobal site and register to create an account.

Select your shipping service and enter your address and contact information. Pay the required shipping fee. Print your shipping label. Log out. Inviting Family and Friends You may want to invite your family, friends, or relatives to visit while you are an international student or exchange visitor at Clark University. In most cases, short-term visitors to the United States must have a valid B-1/B-2 (visitor’s) visa, or be eligible to visit the United States under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). If your visitor needs to apply for their B-1/B-2 visa, they must do so at a U.S. consulate or embassy. You can learn more about the visitor visa program and how to apply here. The ISSO does not issue invitation letters, as the U.S. State Department does not require them or consider them a fact when making a determination whether to issue or deny a visa. The ISSO is not authorized to provide advice on the B-1/B-2 visa process, but is able to provide the following general information that may be helpful for your family or friends who plan to visit you: The B-1/B-2 visa is for persons who are interested in coming to the United States for short-term, temporary trips for either business (B-1) or tourism or medical treatments (B-2). Applicants are required to show that their visit to the United States will be a temporary one and that they will retain connections to their home country, including keeping it as their country of residence. Examples of home country ties include proof of employment, home country family, and property, as well as proof of a return date (e.g., a return trip ticket). While not required or recommended by the U.S. Department of State, you may want to issue a personal invitation written and signed by you. The ISSO provides a sample invitation letter template as a courtesy but cannot guarantee that your visitor will have their visa approved. Along with the invitation letter, you may want to provide documentation of your student status such as a copy of your Form I-20 or Form DS-2019, Enrollment Verification Letter, or Transcript to your visitor for their visa application process.

Clark provides a variety of resources to support its students, faculty, and employees. The health care system in the United States might be very different than in your home country, so we encourage you to read through this section carefully and to reach out to the International Center with any questions or concerns. In addition, health insurance is expensive and is especially complicated in the U.S. We encourage you to read more about health insurance requirements. 2024-25 Student Health Insurance Plan Information For more information about health insurance Health Emergencies If you are on campus and experience a medical emergency, you should contact Clark University Police at 508-793-7575. They will be able to respond to you the quickest and can contact emergency medical services. If you are anywhere off campus, you should call 9-1-1 for all emergencies. A 9-1-1 operator will assist you and, if necessary, call an ambulance to take you to a local hospital. It is important to know that in the U.S., emergency medical services and visits to a hospital emergency department are quite expensive and should be used only for serious medical situations. For routine, non-emergency health care, you should arrange an appointment at Clark’s Office of Health Services, an urgent care center, or your primary care physician. If you don’t have your health insurance card and need to show your insurance information in an emergency, you can download the MyBlue Member app at: https://myblue.bluecrossma.com/student to access your electronic ID card or visit https://www.bluecrossma.org/ to create an online account to access a PDF ID Card. Students: What to Do if You Get Sick Clark’s Office of Health Services, which is located at 501 Park Ave. on the corner of Maywood and Park, is an out-patient clinic and is a good starting place for any non-emergency health issues for all of Clark’s students. Clark University’s matriculated (which means all degree-seeking) undergraduate students may use Clark’s Health Services at no cost to them. Clark’s graduate students and students attending the American Language and Culture Institute (ALCI) or other non-degree programs may use Health Services on a fee-for-service basis. A fee-for-service means that there is a copay that is billed to students. The copay amount depends on the type of care received at Health Services. If you need to see a medical provider at Health Services, you should call Health Services at 1-508-793-7467 to make an appointment before arriving. When Clark’s Health Services is not open, phone advice is provided through UMass Memorial Hahnemann Family Health Center. If you have a non-emergency health issue that cannot wait until the Health Center reopens, you should call Hahnemann Family Health Center’s answering service at 1-508-334-8830. Identify yourself as a Clark student and leave your name and telephone number with the answering service, and the on-call physician will return your call in approximately one hour. The medical provider will ask you some questions and advise a plan of care. If you are referred to an urgent care or emergency room for a medical evaluation, you are responsible for payment. Make sure you provide your health insurance information upon arrival at the urgent care or emergency room. The facility usually will bill your health insurance company, but you are responsible for any copay or remaining balance. It is important to check with the urgent care center to make sure your insurance is accepted before you choose which facility you visit.

Resources to help you improve your application materials Social Security Number (SSN) A Social Security Number (SSN) is a nine-digit number issued for tax reasons by the U.S. Social Security Administration. Employers use Social Security Numbers to report salaries to the U.S. Government for tax purposes. Social Security Numbers are also used for a variety of other purposes, such as to check credit history. Eligibility Students, Faculty, and Staff As an international student, scholar, or employee who is physically in the U.S., you are only eligible to apply for a Social Security Number if your immigration status is valid. You can apply for a Social Security Number only if you are a: F-1 student with on-campus employment, Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorization, or have an Employment Authorization Document (EAD card) for Optional Practical Training (OPT) or other type of F-1 employment. J-1 student with an on-campus employment authorization or Academic Training. J-1 research scholar, professor, or short-term scholar who is paid by Clark. Employee in H-1 or O-1 status. F-1 and J-1 students must have employment authorization from the ISSO prior to applying. Dependents F-2 dependents cannot apply for Social Security Numbers because they are not eligible to work. J-2 or H-4 dependents are eligible to work only if they have an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) card issued by USCIS. Dependents can apply for an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) if they do not have work authorization. Do I need to keep my Social Security Number safe? Yes! Your Social Security Number is a personal identification number that is unique to you, and it can be used to open bank accounts and loans. This means that you should only provide your SSN for valid business, employment, or tax reasons. If you are concerned that someone is asking you for your SSN when they should not be, please contact the International Students and Scholars Office for assistance. Application Process The Office of Student Employment page has instructions to apply for a Social Security Number (SSN). Please review the Student Employment Handbook on this page for information about applying for an SSN. When to Apply F-1 Students Students in F-1 status need a continued attendance I-20 to apply for a Social Security Number. You will receive your Continued Attendance I-20 after your submitted Immigration Check-In is processed. If you are a new student, it is recommended that you wait 7 to 10 days after you receive your updated Continued Attendance I-20 before applying for your Social Security Number to allow for your immigration information to be updated in government databases. J-1 Students or Scholars Students and scholars in J-1 status must also submit their Immigration Check-In and receive an updated DS-2019 prior to applying for a Social Security Number. New H-1B or O-1 Employees Clark faculty, researchers, or employees should apply as soon as possible after arriving in Worcester and starting employment at the University. Receiving Your Social Security Number It may take one to two weeks to process your application. If approved, you will receive a Social Security Card containing your Social Security Number at the U.S. mailing address you provided in your application. Once you have your Social Security Number, you need to provide it to the University so that Clark can update your information with payroll and report your salary and tax information to the U.S. government. Undergraduate and graduate students should either upload the number to the secure link provided on the Student Employment webpage or go to the Payroll Office and provide it to a member of the payroll staff. Your card does not need to be presented. Faculty and employees need to inform Human Resources. Individual Taxpayer ID Number (ITIN) What is an Individual Taxpayer ID Number (ITIN)? An Individual Taxpayer ID Number (ITIN) is a number that is issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. government agency that oversees taxation. They are for individuals who may have taxable income but are not working in the U.S and are not authorized to receive a Social Security Number. Students and scholars who are not working but who have taxable U.S. income, such as taxable scholarships, should apply for an ITIN. ITIN Application Process You will need to gather the following documents to submit an ITIN application: IRS Form W-7 Your unexpired passport Most recent I-20 or DS-2019 Most recent I-94 record Your official financial aid, fellowship, or scholarship financial award letter Please visit the IRS website for the most up-to-date information on where and how to submit your ITIN application. Contact the ISSO if you believe you might need an ITIN before applying to confirm if it is necessary. Income Taxes As an international student, scholar, or employee at Clark, you may have federal and state tax reporting obligations. Tax laws are complicated and the ISSO is not authorized to provide any tax advice. However, we hope the information and links provided below are helpful. The U.S. tax system is based on a calendar year (Jan. 1 to Dec. 31). This means that the income you earn during this time period is used to calculate the amount owed in taxes for that year. U.S. income taxes are calculated at both the U.S. federal (national) level as well as the state and sometimes even the local (city) level. There are different tax rules and different tax rates for federal, state, and local income taxes. The U.S. has a “pay as you go” tax system. This means that taxes are usually taken out or “withheld” from your pay each pay period. Then, you submit a tax return by April 15 of the following year to determine whether you paid too much or too little tax during the year. If you have paid too much, you will get a refund. If you have paid too little, you will need to pay the difference between what you had withheld and what you owe in taxes. U.S. Federal Tax Residency In U.S. federal tax laws, being categorized a resident or non-resident has several effects on taxes. Tax residency is used to determine the amount you are taxed, your tax treaty benefits, and the kind of tax forms you need to submit. Under U.S. tax law, all U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents are considered residents for tax purposes. Most students in F and J status are considered tax non-residents during their first five calendar years in F or J student status. J-1 scholars are considered non-residents for the first two calendar years in the U.S. For more information about determining your tax residency status, please visit the IRS website where there is information in multiple languages. You may find IRS Publication 519 helpful, which is a tax guide for non-residents published by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Tax Treaty Benefits Tax residents and tax non-residents can take advantage of different benefits and claim different deductions (deductions reduce the amount of income tax you owe) based on a tax treaty. A tax treaty is an agreement between the U.S. and another country that allows for residents of the foreign country to be taxed at a reduced rate or be exempt from U.S. income taxes. It is important to note that not every country has a tax treaty with the U.S., and the terms of each treaty are different and can change year to year. A full detailed list of current tax treaties between the U.S. and other countries can be found in IRS Publication 901 — U.S. Tax Treaties. If you are working at Clark, you can request that your treaty benefits be applied at the time of tax withholding (see next section on Tax Withholding) or your annual tax filing (see section on Annual Tax Filing). You must have a valid Social Security Number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) when requesting your tax treaty benefits (see Social Security Numbers and ITINs). Clark uses a software that helps determine if a student is eligible to take advantage of a tax treaty. If you receive a taxable award (funds above tuition) or are employed at Clark, you will receive a link to complete a “FNIS” form online. Please make sure you complete this form immediately so that a determination can be made and your withholding amount adjusted accordingly. You will need to update your FNIS form each year you are at Clark. Tax Withholding Tax withholding is when you have taxes taken from your earnings by the entity providing you with U.S. income, and the entity sends it to the IRS and state tax agencies, if applicable, on your behalf. In addition to employment, certain other types of income-generating activities like stipends and prizes and awards may be subject to tax withholding. The amount of income that is withheld for tax depends on your tax residency and your estimated yearly tax obligation. In addition, some tax non-residents may have tax treaty benefits (see above) that will affect the overall rate (percentage) that is withheld. Please review the Student Employment Handbook page for the Student Employment Verification Policy document, which includes information about treaty benefits. Clark Employees: If you are an employee, you will submit your withholding forms to Human Resources as part of the hiring process. If you ever need to change your withholding, you should contact Human Resources. Tax Forms Upon Employment When you start employment, you may be required to complete forms that tell your employer how much tax to withhold from your salary. Please review the information under Tax Regulations on the Payroll website for additional information Undergraduate Students With Campus Employment If you are an undergraduate student with an on-campus employment position and have questions regarding your Form W-4 and other IRS forms, please contact the Office of Financial Assistance. Graduate Students and Employees If you are a graduate student with an on-campus employment position or an international Clark employee and have questions regarding your Form W-4 or other IRS forms, please contact the Payroll Office. Filing Federal and State Income Tax Returns Federal Returns All international students and scholars are required to file some kind of tax return to the U.S. government. Even if you did not receive any income, you are still required to complete and submit Form 8843. It is important to understand that filing a tax return does not necessarily mean that you will owe taxes. In fact, you may receive a refund if the amount that was withheld from your pay was more than your tax obligation. Massachusetts Returns If you have earned less than $8,000 gross during the tax year, you do not need to file a Massachusetts state tax return. However, if you did work and taxes were withheld, you could receive a refund and therefore filing a return would be beneficial to you. Obtaining Your W-2 Form A W-2 is a tax form that you need in order to file your tax returns if you worked in the U.S. during the tax year. If you worked for Clark and elected to receive your W-2 electronically, you can view your W-2 on CUWeb. Follow these instructions: Log in to CUWeb. Click Main Menu on left side of screen, then click Employment Information. Click Tax Forms then click W-2 Year End Earnings Statement. Choose Tax Year 2020. Click Display then click Printable W-2 (bottom of the screen). Enter your Clark password to see your W-2. Sprintax Non-Resident Tax Preparation Software What is Sprintax? The International Center has purchased a license for a tax preparation software specifically designed for international students and scholars who are non-residents for tax purposes. Clark students and scholars are able to use Sprintax free of charge to file their federal tax returns. You can also use this software to file your Massachusetts taxes but will have to pay a fee directly to Sprintax for that service. Sprintax Webinars To assist with tax filing season, Sprintax typically offers a series of free webinars that are available to Clark students and scholars. More information about this will be sent to you directly from the ISSO. How to Use Sprintax You will receive an email with a code and detailed instructions from the ISSO in January Register on the Sprintax website and follow the simple instructions.

Living on campus is a key part of your educational experience. Visit the Office of Residential Life and Housing for more information about living on campus. Third- and fourth-year students and graduate students are also welcome to apply to live on campus with the Office of Residential Life and Housing. Off-Campus Housing How to Find an Apartment There are many options for living off campus in Worcester. There are many apartments within walking distance of campus and others that are a short ride away. It all depends on what type of living situation you are looking for. The process of searching for an apartment in the U.S. may be different than in your home country. We have created several resources to help you! Housing Guide Please note that you are expected to have a place to stay upon arriving in Worcester. Clark does not have temporary accommodations for students. If you are not able to move into an apartment right away, please consult the short-term housing section of the Housing Guide. Driving and State IDs The ISSO strongly recommends obtaining a Massachusetts state ID or MA driving license and storing your passport in a secure location. Click here to view the slides from the Driving in the U.S. Information Session held on January 25, 2023. Driver’s Licenses and State IDs International students, scholars, and employees may apply to the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV) for a Massachusetts driver’s permit, license, or Massachusetts ID card. The process, in general, to obtain your Massachusetts’ driver’s license is: Start an online application for a learner’s permit. Study for the written permit test by reviewing the Driver’s Manual. Go to a RMV Service Center with your required identification documents (see below for list of documents). Upon passing your exam, you will get your learner’s permit and and you can begin to practice driving in the U.S. Schedule your road test with the RMV. Pass your road test and pay your license fees. Obtain your license! (Your permit may act as your temporary license until you receive your actual driver’s license.) Note: If you do not already know how to drive, you may want to take lessons. Here are a few driving schools in the area. LaPortes Driving School Richways Auto School LLC Best Driving School Inc. When you do go to the RMV to complete your ID, permit or license application, you need to bring the following documents with you. Valid passport (no visa required) Original or certified copy of a birth certificate OR Foreign National Identification Card OR Foreign Drivers License OR Driver License from any US state or territory OR Marriage certificate issued by any US state or territory Social Security number (SSN) status (if you don’t have a Social Security number, you can complete an affidavit of no SSN at the RMV office) Proof of Massachusetts residency (find the full list of accepted documents here). Please note, all documents must be originals. Photocopies and laminated documents will not be accepted. Driving in Massachusetts with a Foreign License Effective July 2018, Massachusetts Law was changed to allow licensed drivers from any country to operate registered motor vehicles in Massachusetts. Read complete details. If your foreign driver’s license is not in English or does not contain an English translation, you must obtain and carry either a valid International Driving Permit or a translation into English alternative document that properly identifies the license holder and translates the relevant license information into English. This document can be found on Mass.gov/RMV in the “Learner’s permit, driver’s license and ID card forms” section. An International Driving Permit (IDP) does not allow you to drive legally in the U.S. by itself; you must also carry a foreign license along with your IDP. Converting a Foreign License into a Massachusetts License Some foreign licenses may be converted into a Massachusetts driver’s license without a written test or road test. For more information, go to the RMV web site. Owning a Car Owning a car in the U.S. is very expensive. We recommend not purchasing a car unless you plan to live in Massachusetts for an extended period of time or if you do not have convenient public transportation options. If you do purchase and own a car, you need to keep in mind the following information: You are required to have car insurance. You are required to register your car with the State of Massachusetts and pay annual registration fees. Your car must be inspected every year and an inspection sticker must be placed on your car’s windshield. You must pay local car (excise) taxes. These are taxes that you pay to your city or town of residence. The Registry of Motor Vehicles will inform your city or town of residence when you register a car and they will send you a bill for the excise taxes. You may have potential car repairs. Purchasing snow tires for driving safely in snowy and wintery conditions (this is especially important in and around Worcester) is highly recommended. Keep in mind off-street parking may be restricted during times of significant snowfall. When driving in Worcester and in the surrounding area, there is often traffic. Understanding the rules of the road is essential for being a safe driver. It is also important to know that each state has its own driving rules, so if you are going to one of the surrounding states, it is important for you to research and know the driving rules. There are parking restrictions on the streets around Clark and if you park somewhere that is restricted, you may get a parking ticket with a fine or your car can be towed. If your car is towed, you will have to pay money to the company that towed your car and this can be very expensive. Clark has on-campus parking that you can purchase. For more information visit the Campus Parking and Permits. Driving Laws and Immigration It is extremely important for international students, scholars, and employees to understand and follow all requirements for driving responsibly while in the U.S. You should be especially aware of the consequences of driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol or other drugs. A DUI arrest or conviction may lead to revocation of your visa, as well as other extremely serious legal consequences. If you are subject to arrest or conviction due to driving under the influence or as a result of another serious driving violation, we encourage you to consult with the International Students and Scholars Office and a qualified immigration and/or criminal attorney to assist you. Safety and Conduct Clark is committed to providing all of its members with a safe campus. If you want to discuss a safety concern, Clark University Police Department should be your first point of contact. General Safety Tips Be aware of your surroundings at all times. In particular, do not allow yourself to be distracted by your cell phone. Try to travel with others, especially at night. Unless you are traveling, the ISSO strongly recommends keeping your passport in a secure location. If working or studying late, arrange to leave with a friend or use the Clark Ride service. If traveling alone at night, tell a friend or roommate where you are, where you are going, and your expected arrival time. You can also download the free RAVE Guardian App to set a safety timer to check in with you if you don’t arrive at your destination by the expected time. Familiarize yourself with campus emergency “blue light” boxes (E-boxes) which will quickly put you in touch with a Clark University UP officer. Guard your personal property, including laptops, cell phones, wallets, backpacks, and bicycles. Take care not to drink excessively, and never drive or operate a motor vehicle if you have consumed alcohol. More safety tips can be found here. Conduct and Discrimination Concerns Clark is committed to providing an environment free of harassment, misconduct, and discrimination. It is also dedicated to being a community dedicated to learning as well as to the intellectual, personal, and social development of all of its members. For more details regarding this, visit the Dean of Students Office. All Clark students are bound by the Student Code of Conduct, which outlines the standards of behavior that support the educational mission of the University. If you have any questions about anything in the Student Code of Conduct, please feel free to contact the International Students and Scholars Office. Reporting Concerns If you wish to report a concern regarding harassment, misconduct, or discrimination, we encourage you to take advantage of different resources available to you. Clark University is committed to providing a campus environment where all students, staff, and faculty are safe from sexual violence, harassment, and discrimination. A strong Clark community is one where all people engage in relationships based on mutual care and respect. Visit Clark University’s Office of Title IX for more information. The Bias Incident Intervention Team responds to reports of bias and/or hate. To learn more about Clark’s Bias Incident Response Protocol, visit its website. We further encourage you reach out to an International Students and Scholars Office staff member about any concerns you may have about your experiences as an international student, scholar, or employee at Clark. What to Do if You are a Victim of a Scam What are Scams? Scams are malicious attempts to persuade one to surrender valuables, pay money, or disclose private information through deceptive and fraudulent means for the purpose of personal gain. Scams are illegal, and can lead to loss of valuables, monetary assets and/or identity. Click here to read some tips on how to recover from identity theft and stay safe in the future. Common Scams There are many different types of scams. Examples of common scams and examples include A threat to revoke a visa, green card, or work authorization A demand for immediate payment of past-due taxes Scams can also consist of fraudulent offers for goods and services upon receipt of funds, such as: Provision of a social security card or an apartment for rent. How Do Scams Work? Scammers use different methods to deceive their victims. Scams can happen by telephone, email, and mail. For international students and scholars, telephone scams are among the most common. Many telephone scams have the following features: Someone identifies themselves as a government officer such as a police officer, tax agent, Social Security official, or immigration official. The call seems “real.” The caller may know a lot about you. The caller tells you that you broke the law, owe taxes, lost your immigration status, or missed an important legal deadline. The caller demands that you pay a large fine immediately or face arrest, jail, or deportation and insists that you act immediately and insists that you do not have time to contact your school, the Office of Global Engagement, or a lawyer, because they are “coming right now to arrest you.” The caller demands payment through unusual means such as gift cards, Bitcoin payment, or Western Union transfer. A recent trend has been that the caller identifies as an official from your home country’s government. In this case, always ask for a call back number and consult your consulate or embassy to confirm the authenticity of the call. How to Protect Yourself from a Scam Never give out personal information, including your address, Social Security Number, or credit card or banking information over the phone or over email. Ask the caller to meet you at the local police station. If they refuse or hang up, it’s a scam. Ask the caller for their name, badge number, and a phone number to call them back. If it feels like you are receiving a strange demand over the phone, email, or in person, disconnect the call and call the Office of Global Engagement or the Clark University Police Department at 1-508-793-7575. You do not need to respond immediately to their request. In all cases, if you receive a demand that seems surprising, shocking, and unexpected, it is likely a scam. Hang up and contact the International Students and Scholars Office or Clark University Police at 1-508-793-7575. Quick Tip: The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Social Security Administration (SSA) will never call you directly about tax or Social Security matters. While it is possible you might be contacted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security or by the FBI, these direct contacts are extremely rare and will never lead to a demand for money. Always get the caller’s information and then contact the Office of Global Engagement and/or the Clark University Police Department to assist you. Identity Theft and Phishing Scams Identity theft and “phishing” scams use email, text, and other techniques to steal your personal information. This information can include your name, date of birth, Social Security Number, address, credit card or bank account numbers, and other information. With this information, identity thieves can open credit cards or accounts in your name or gain access to your established accounts. The easiest way to avoid identity theft is to keep your personal information safe and secret using these tips: Never give out your sensitive personal data, especially your date of birth and Social Security Number, over email. Never click on links in an email from a strange or untrusted source. If an email seems strange and it looks to be from someone you know, take a close look at the email address. Or better yet, before clicking on a link, confirm with the person that they sent you an email or a message with a link. Use two-factor authentication on your email and other online accounts. Shred paper records with your personal information. Use resources through the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to protect your identity and report identity theft. For additional information, see How to Recognize a Phishing Scam. Know Your Rights International students and scholars are entitled to certain U.S. constitutional rights and protections while in the United States. You should contact the ISSO with any questions about your non-immigrant visa status and for assistance in seeking additional information regarding your legal rights while in the U.S. Please note that the information provided on this page does not constitute legal advice but is intended for information purposes. Please feel free to contact the International Students and Scholars Office if you have any questions or concerns.

A Problem of Practice (PoP) is an issue of consequence impacting a community, profession, or discipline. Examining a problem of practice involves active learning, such as project-based learning, community-engaged experiential learning, and ongoing reflection. Through PoP courses, students will collaborate with alumni and experts at local and global organizations — from theatre groups, historical societies, and media outlets to government agencies, Fortune 500 companies, and NGOs. PoP courses call on students and faculty to explore uncertainty and engage in contexts where there isn’t a predefined answer. As you do, you’ll build specialized knowledge, marketable skills, and a network of professional contacts that will benefit you long into the future.

Typically limited to 16 students, FYI courses let you begin your Clark career by developing close relationships with a professor and group of peers who share your interests. Your FYI professor will likely be your academic adviser until you declare a major, and will help you navigate your transition from high school to college. You can choose from more than 30 different courses, which change from year to year. No matter which FYI you take, you’ll learn in a supportive, welcoming environment and you’ll build crucial skills — including critical thinking, writing, and debating — that will increase your confidence and success in other courses. What First-Year Intensive courses can I choose? We offer three types of FYIs: Topic-focused. Some FYI courses focus in-depth on a specific topic within an academic discipline, such as history, philosophy, music, education, etc. Others stretch across disciplines, addressing social issues or intellectual debates from multiple perspectives. Example: Middle East Politics Research-oriented. In this type of FYI course, you get a taste of what it’s like to add new knowledge to a field — from framing a question to gathering and analyzing data, drawing conclusions, and presenting findings. Example: Border Crossings: Narratives of Travel, Exile, and Immigration Introduction to a discipline. Some FYI courses serve as introductions to specific disciplines, and potentially to your major area of study. These courses may be a prerequisite to higher-level courses. Example: Introduction to Chemistry. Depending on what major you’re considering, your FYI can be an opportunity to get started early on its requirements. While Clark does not require you to take an introductory course in your intended major as your First-Year Intensive, you may choose to do so, depending on the major’s requirements outlined in its catalog description. How do I choose a First-Year Intensive course? You may choose to pursue a course in a topic you already have a passion for, or you might prefer a course that will introduce you to an entirely new subject. Keep an open mind as you read course descriptions and identify your top three to five choices. When you meet with your summer adviser in July, you will select an FYI as one of your fall courses. A few additional guidelines: If you select a course that carries a VE (verbal expression) designation, you must have been placed at the VE level required to register for this course. Your VE level is determined by your writing sample. You may register for only one FYI. Given the small class size, many courses fill up quickly. You should have several backups in mind — and register early — to have the best chance of securing your first choice.

Taken across diverse disciplines, these courses allow students to develop critical thinking skills, respect for other cultures and perspectives, and introduce students to new ways of seeing, thinking, and knowing humans and the natural world. The breadth of Core courses allows students to make vital connections across subjects, and understand the world in diverse ways, so that they may be active, engaged global citizens. The curriculum begins with a First Year Intensive course, and is completed by satisfying nine requirements across five disciplines. Through Clark Core, students develop their current educational goals while simultaneously exploring new interests, acquiring new skills, and developing ways of thinking. Please Note Clark Core only applies to students enrolling at Clark on or after Fall 2024. Students who have already started their academic journey should refer to the Program of Liberal Studies.

Each provides intellectual immersion and sought-after skills that prepare you to succeed wherever you go after Clark. Clark’s programs offer something for nearly every type of student: computer science, comparative literature, geography, philosophy, entrepreneurship, international development and social change, and many others. Not interested in a traditional route? We also offer interdisciplinary programs, student-designed majors, and a wide variety of minors and concentrations that will help you take ownership of your education. No matter which discipline (or disciplines) you make your focus, you’ll work closely with faculty members and classmates, explore the relationship between theory and practice, and build a foundation for advanced study and career success. Explore Our Programs Major Opportunities Clark’s more than 30 majors offer exceptional opportunities to put your knowledge into action and learn through firsthand research and creative work. For example: An environmental science major may take a course that involves lectures by local conservation experts and hands-on training at ecological sites throughout Massachusetts. A biochemistry and molecular biology major might conduct laboratory research alongside a professor and their peers, and have their results published in an academic journal. A music major may take a course that involves both teaching local elementary school students how to play instruments and exploring the relationship between the arts and social action. A geography major with an interest in urban development might complete an internship in a developing nation to help design and create improved public spaces. A media, culture, and the arts major interested in journalism might learn firsthand from staff at local newspapers about the challenges and responsibilities of an urban reporter. Declaring a Major You may formally declare your major as early as the second semester of your first year at Clark, and all students are required to declare a major by the end of their sophomore year. The number of courses required for a major at Clark can range from 12 to 19. If you are interested in some of the more intensive majors (such as biology, biochemistry and molecular biology, chemistry, management, or physics), you are encouraged to begin taking courses relevant to those majors in your first semester. However, most students should feel comfortable using their first few semesters to explore various academic disciplines throughout the liberal arts. Minors and Concentrations A minor or concentration can be chosen to complement your major, or to provide you with an opportunity to explore a completely different field of study. With a small number of exceptions, all major fields of study at Clark offer a companion minor. In addition, you can choose from five stand-alone minors — creative writing, education, German studies, innovation and entrepreneurship, and marketing — and 12 interdisciplinary concentrations, including Africana studies; computational science; health, science, and society; Holocaust and genocide studies; and mathematical biology and bioinformatics. Declaring a Minor/Concentration You must declare your intention to complete a minor or concentration by the end of your junior year. Minors and concentrations require the completion of a minimum of six courses. Still Undecided? If you are undecided about your academic direction, your summer and pre-major adviser can help. Talking with your classmates and professors is another great way to learn where your talents lie and to clarify your interests.

Our Diversity and Inclusion course requirement ensures that every Clarkie benefits from the vital exchange of ideas and experiences provided by this rich campus. By understanding and appreciating diverse experiences, we challenge beliefs and assumptions. We extend one another’s range of experience. We teach one another to see the world from different perspectives. We share one another’s concerns, and respect one another’s dignity — regardless of race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, age, ability, citizenship, nationality, or ethnicity. Every undergraduate is required to complete a course with a Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) attribute. Most of our D&I courses have a substantial focus on race, gender, or ethnicity, but others may address issues around religion, age, sexuality, ability, nationality, or class. All D&I courses engage students in the critical analysis of topics such as power, intersectionality, inequality, marginality, and identity. Courses fulfilling other requirements in the Program of Liberal Studies or in any major, concentration, or minor requirements may simultaneously fulfill the D&I requirement.
