Submit Search Query Enter a search query. Submit Search Query Volumes Editorial Board Faculty Volumes Editorial Board Faculty The Scholarly Undergraduate Research Journal (SURJ) is a student-operated organization dedicated to the pursuit of truth and knowledge. Submit Your Research Peer Review and Copy Editing Teams Please Note SURJ was not able to publish a 2019-2020 sixth volume due to operational difficulties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. SURJ will instead publish a combined years journal in the spring of 2021 that presents all articles accepted in the past 2019-2020 year and the current 2020-2021 year. Clark University’s Scholarly Undergraduate Research Journal (SURJ) is the institution’s first student-run undergraduate interdisciplinary research journal. It aims to promote critical thinking, practical application of knowledge, and awareness and recognition of ongoing research throughout the University. As a completely student-run journal, SURJ members are provided with the opportunity to experience the wide range of publication processes — either as a staff member or an author. Through the collaboration with SURJ’s faculty review boards, the journal seeks to create an avenue for student-faculty partnerships, as well as cross-departmental scholarly dialogue. Students can become involved with SURJ by joining our peer review or copy editing teams or submitting research. Faculty can become involved by joining the SURJ faculty advisory board. SURJ accepts submissions in two waves. It is recommended that authors submit their manuscripts for the first wave so that they will have the opportunity to revise and resubmit in the second wave if their article is not accepted. The deadlines for each wave of submissions are the following: Deadline I: Nov. 5, 2021 at midnight Deadline II: TBA Volume V It is serendipitous that we are celebrating 50 years of the Robert H. Goddard Library as we celebrate five years of SURJ. As an attempt to toast this, we celebrate the history, beauty, and importance of the library in the community’s consciousness as a center of knowledge on campus. The five pieces featured in this year’s issue will give you a glimpse into the scholarship and dialogue on campus.

We encourage you to pursue independent research under the supervision of a faculty mentor. Student research activities include: Honors theses Inter- or intradisciplinary collaborative research on cutting-edge problems from a specific field of computer science Reading courses on advanced topics Qualified self-designed projects Below, check out some of mathematics students’ most recent independent research projects. Mathematics Student Projects Our Universe as a Manifold Mateo Gomez (now a 3-2 combined plan student at Columbia University), Sherman-Fairchild Fellow; summer research 2017 Mentor: Prof. Amir Aazami This research project gave a rigorous introduction to understanding spaces that locally look just like our familiar space, but globally may be curved. The perfect example of this is earth: locally it looks flat, but globally it is a sphere. In fact, our very universe itself is assumed to have this local/global property, but being four-dimensional — three dimensions of space and one of time — we cannot “see” this as we can with Earth. Such spaces are called manifolds. The key question is: how does one do calculus on manifolds? How does one study their geometry, their curvature? E.g., the shortest distance between two points on earth can no longer be a straight line, because earth is curved, so how does one answer such questions now? The difficult task is that, given the “local/global” relationship that manifolds possess, one cannot rely solely on coordinates: one must think, so to speak, coordinate-independently. In fact, everything from the ground up has to be re-formulated: differentiability, vectors, the gradient, the Jacobian of a function, etc. All this needs to be understood before one can even begin to talk about geometry, or curvature, or gravity, or the universe and Einstein’s equations. Designing New Evolutionary Algorithms for Parameter Estimation Mike Gaiewski (now a Ph.D. student in Applied Math at UConn), Sherman-Fairchild Fellow; summer research 2017 and 2018 Mentor: Prof. Jacqueline Dresch One of the most important steps in mathematical modeling of a biological system is fitting the parameters of your model to experimental data. There is an extremely large number of different parameter estimation algorithms available, and an important question to ask is: what parameter estimation method should be used on my particular problem? In an attempt to answer this question in the context of modeling gene regulation, Michael developed and implemented novel parameter estimation algorithms based on the principles of evolution. Topics in Functional Analysis Andrew Mezzi, Sherman-Fairchild Fellow; summer research 2018 Mentor: Prof. Gideon Maschler Andrew worked on a project that encompassed many different topics from functional analysis: infinite-dimensional linear algebra, operators, and applications of solutions to ordinary differential equations. During the summer, Andrew was also exposed to a variety of internet resources and professional tools of the working mathematician, including the arXiv, MathSciNet, LaTeX and TeX-related editors, as well as the MathOverflow and StackExchange websites. Topics in Differential Geometry Emma Kirkman-Davis, summer reading course 2017 Tenzing Gurung, summer reading course 2017 Wenwen Shen, honors thesis 2016 Mentor: Prof. Gideon Maschler Emma, Tenzing, and Wenwen all worked on topics in differential geometry. Their work focused on curves and surfaces, lengths on these, intrinsic and extrinsic curvature, and the relation between curvature and topology (i.e., global geometry, the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem). Bioinformatic Analysis of Transcription Factor Binding Sites Navid Al Hossain, Sherman-Fairchild Fellow; summer research 2016 and 2017 Regan Conrad, Sherman-Fairchild Fellow; summer research 2017 and 2018 Mentor: Prof. Jacqueline Dresch Predicting the location of protein binding sites within a genome is a difficult task, but is an integral part of furthering our understanding of gene regulation. Traditional methods involve PWMs (position weight matrices), which rely on the underlying assumption that each nucleotide within a TF binding site is independent of the other nucleotides. More recently, models have been implemented which relax this assumption to include dependence on neighboring nucleotides (i.e. a string of contiguous nucleotides). Navid’s project focused on analyzing the correlation between the frequency of binding sites within raw sequence data and the bioinformatically predicted ‘strength’ of these binding sites. His work has been instrumental in the experimental design and continued collaboration between the Dresch group in the Mathematics and Computer Science Department, the Drewell lab in Biology, and the Spratt lab in Chemistry. Regan’s project focused on analyzing bioinformatic predictions of binding sites within core promoter regions from Drosophila melanogaster to investigate potential nucleotide dependencies and improve the predictive power of these algorithms. Image Processing and Drosophila Embryos Logan Bishop-Van Horn, directed study, spring 2016 Teodor Nicola-Antoniu, summer research 2016 Mentor: Prof. Jacqueline Dresch Using raw data from microscope images in modeling gene expression levels presents the researcher with many challenges; one must be able to remove any extraneous information from the image and be able to compare images prepared and taken from different embryos on different days. For this reason, Logan and Teodor’s projects focused on creating a pipeline for processing these images, including noise and background subtraction, normalization, spatial registration, and extraction of quantitative levels of gene expression. Counting Complicated Combinatorial Sets using Markov Chain Monte-Carlo Algorithms Trung Ngo (now an application developer at Morgan Stanley), honors thesis 2018 Mentor: Prof. Michael Satz Can you imagine a set that is finite but impossible to practically count even with a supercomputer? One way to build such a set is to define it as a subset all permutations of the integers 1 through N. For example, our hard-to-count set may be all such permutations satisfying some constraint involving these integers and the position they’re in. Depending on the constraint, the hard-to-count set may not be particularly large, but the parent set (which has N! elements) may well be too large for an exhaustive check-and-count approach. Monte-Carlo Markov chain methods introduce randomness to estimate the sizes and other features of such complicated combinatorial sets. Trung Ngo applied four algorithms to one such counting problem. The algorithms were implemented in Python and tested and analyzed for performance, convergence, and accuracy. Differential Geometry and Brain Images Franklin Feingold (now a project manager at Stanford University), honors thesis 2015 Mentor: Prof. Gideon Maschler In recent years, there have been multiple studies that use techniques in differential geometry to analyze brain MRIs. Franklin’s project focused on exploring some of the methods used and understanding how differential geometry can be used in modern-day medicine. Mathematics behind Plasmas First-year students in the Diving into Research course, 2014-15 Mentor: Prof. Natalia Sternberg Plasma televisions, plasma lights, the heat around the space shuttle and communication blackout caused by plasma, laser treatments in medicine, and production of microchips for computers are just a few applications of plasmas that became a big part of our lives. Students will learn about plasmas by developing and studying mathematical models that explain the experiments and help to obtain plasmas with certain properties. Diving into Research In addition to independent research projects, our department periodically provides opportunities for first-year and upper-class students to work in groups with faculty members on research projects through the course Diving into Research (MATH110, MATH 111). MATH110 Diving into Research is a year-long opportunity for first-year students to work in groups with faculty members on research projects. Recent topics have included: Modeling re-entry communication blackout on the space shuttle caused by plasma Modeling gene regulation in a developing fruit fly embryo Groups are limited to eight students. Students earn 0.5 credits each semester, and the full year is necessary to obtain credit. May be repeated as MATH111. Note: Neither MATH 110 nor MATH 111 count as credit towards the Math major. A Sampling of Course Descriptions for Diving into Research Mathematics Behind Plasmas Plasma televisions, plasma lights, the heat around the space shuttle and communication blackout caused by plasma, laser treatments in medicine, and production of microchips for computers are just a few applications of plasmas that became a big part of our lives. Students will learn about plasmas by developing and studying mathematical models that explain the experiments and help to obtain plasmas with certain properties. (Instructor: N.Sternberg) The Mathematics Behind Gene Regulation This course will introduce the idea of mathematically modeling gene regulation in a developing organism. Students will learn how mathematicians work with biologists to design simple experiments and derive equations to model gene expression. We will also explore some of the computational approaches currently being implemented in modern biology, including bioinformatics, data processing, and parameter estimation. This one-year course will be an interactive experience for students interested in learning more about the interface of mathematics, computer science, and molecular biology. (Instructor: J.Dresch) Geometry Geometry is a branch of mathematics which closely relies on visual intuition. As such, parts of it are accessible even without obtaining extensive preliminary background, while still being deep and thought-provoking. In this seminar-style class, we explore the subject from a number of different perspectives, thus demonstrating its richness. Among the possible topics chosen are Projective and Differential Geometry, and symmetries and their relation to the mathematical concept of a group. Our guiding principle for these choices will be their accessibility to direct geometric intuition and imagination. The need for prior mathematical background will be kept at a minimum level. We will also be employing computer graphics and related software for visual exploration. The main purpose is to have fun while appreciating geometry.

Gideon Maschler Complex differential geometry What do distances we measure on a surface tell us about how it curves? As it turns out, quite a bit. And if we know how it curves everywhere, can we determine if it has a hole like a bagel or two or three holes like a pretzel? If we consider all the shapes a balloon can take, is the perfectly spherical one, the one whose curvature is most equally distributed everywhere? Can we tell if we are walking on a surface whether we can continue forever, or are bound to fall off it at the horizon? In differential geometry, we explore such questions on spaces that may have more than just the two dimensions that surfaces have. Complex geometry explores the same topics on spaces that are constrained in ways that are related to the invention of complex numbers. ··· Gideon Maschler Complex differential geometry What do distances we measure on a surface tell us about how it curves?

Admissions deadlines are rolling each semester (see table). Submit transcripts, a faculty recommendation, and proof of good standing. Credit is granted for courses with a grade of C or higher. At least two years must be completed at Clark. International Applicants About 5% of Clark’s students come from outside the U.S. each year. If English is not your native language, you will need to submit an official TOEFL, Duolingo, or IELTS score report. We will consider your English proficiency holistically, based on your scores, transcript, essay, and letters of recommendation. We also strongly encourage all applicants to sit for an interview. This is especially important for applicants who do not speak English as a native language. Admissions for Spring Each year, Clark admits over 50 first-year and transfer students for spring admission. This term is becoming popular among first-year students who prefer to take a semester off or do a gap semester before starting college.
