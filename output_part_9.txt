Through this system Clark researchers can post studies and connect to potential research participants. Who Can Participate in Research? Everyone is welcome to join the participant pool, including those who aren’t affiliated with Clark! Clark students, staff, faculty, as well as community members, can sign up for the participant pool. There are studies for children and families as well. You can register for an account here: Clark Participant Sign-Up To increase your chances of being invited to a study, you should complete the “Prescreen Survey,” which collects basic demographic information. Are you a Clark-affiliated Researcher? We can add any IRB-approved study to the Research Participation System (provided the use of the SONA Research Participation System has been granted approval by IRB for the specific study). Simply complete this Google Form to request a researcher account: SONA Experiment Registration Form Once registered in the system, you can post your research studies. Each study is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Once approved, you can email invitations to qualifying participants. Important Information for Researchers: Clark IRB does not require or necessarily endorse the SONA Research Participation System. Any use of the system must be approved by the IRB in advance for each individual study. The IRB may accept or reject the use of the system for individual studies (or ask for revisions to a proposed use of the system) on a case-by-case basis. If you wish to use the Research Participation System for research with human subjects, you must first describe this proposed use as part of your Mentor IRB application. This description must explain how you will use the system within your study. Once IRB approval or exemption is granted, you may then register your study with the Research Participant System. If you have any questions about this procedure, please contact the IRB office. Questions For any questions or concerns about the Research Participation System at Clark University, please email: SONA@clarku.edu. Login to Sona For Course Credit Clark Faculty Professors can incentivize students to participate in studies for course credit.

The President of Clark University designates the Associate Provost and Dean of Research as the authorizing official responsible for implementing research policy with advice and counsel of the Research Board. The Dean also supports and oversees OSPR in the administration, management and compliance of externally-funded university-based research. Because external funding imposes certain legal obligations on the University with respect to its use, management, and accountability, OSPR works with a range of other University offices, and members of the faculty to ensure the effective management of the sponsored programs process. Clark University strongly supports and encourages outside grants and contracts for sponsored activity. The University promotes proposals that: Conform with the recognized objectives of Clark University and sponsor policies and procedures. Impose no restriction upon the publication of research results unless a clear national emergency requires such limitation. Represent genuine research and educational interests of the principal investigator or project director. In general, proposals for sponsored projects must meet the following terms and conditions: A line of scholarly or scientific inquiry, specified to a substantial level of detail. A line-item budget that details expenses by activity, function, or project period. Terms that specify deliverables that include technical reports, or performance objectives such as a specified time and place of service delivery or activity milestones. Terms that specify fiduciary commitments such as financial reports, audits, and/or an obligation to return unexpended funds at the conclusion of the project. Terms that provide for the disposition of either or intangible properties, which may result from the project. Tangible properties include equipment, records, technical reports, theses, or dissertations. Intangible properties include data, copyrights, or inventions.

Sponsored program agreements include grants, contracts, sub-awards, and cooperative agreements. A sponsor, or funder, may be a government entity (international, federal, state, or local), a foundation, a private corporation, or a non-profit organization such as another university or independent research institute. OSPR can help you identify grant sponsors and develop proposals. Our office has numerous resources for preparing your grant application, including a Proposal Development Guide, required internal forms, budgeting tools and guidelines, information on indirect costs, checklists, and more. Submitting a Grant Application Full grant applications to government entities must be received in the Office of Sponsored Programs and Research (OSPR), and foundation grant applications must be received in Corporate and Foundation Relations at least ten (10) business days before the sponsor’s published deadline. As soon as you start planning a grant proposal, please send us a quick message with the “WHO” “WHAT” “WHEN” “WHERE” so we can put it on our calendar and schedule a Pre-Proposal Meeting! Submit an Early Notification Form Applications submitted to OSPR for review should include (at a minimum)*: The Proposal Summary & Approval Form with all necessary signatures A Financial Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form from each Clark person written into the grant A final (or close to final) project narrative A line item detailed budget (spreadsheet) A detailed budget justification/narrative Proposal-specific and ancillary documents required by sponsor Draft of any required letter of support that must be signed by the Director of OSPR, Dean of Research, Provost, or President. * Use the Pre-award Proposal Guidelines to help guide your proposal development. Our Services Helping Identify Potential Sponsors OSPR provides faculty with individual notices of funding opportunities, conducts individualized funding searches using various databases, and trains faculty, staff, and graduate students to use grant databases for funding searches. OSPR also works closely with Corporate and Foundation Relations to identify support from private sources for sponsored programs. All Clark community members can also use Pivot-RP to search for funding opportunities. Helping Develop Proposals OSPR works with faculty, staff, and students to prepare proposals for sponsored projects. This can involve serving as a liaison to sponsors for insight on funding opportunities, providing strategic advice on preparing proposals, assisting in building a budget, facilitating the creation of teams of participants for collaborative projects, writing and editorial assistance for large institutional grants, and light editing for individual submissions. Overseeing the Approval Routing Process OSPR has primary oversight responsibility for the timely review of proposals submitted on behalf of the institution. The review process is designed to ensure that the application conforms to university and sponsor guidelines with respect to academic appropriateness of the project, commitments of faculty and staff time, budgetary provisions, requirements for space and facilities, and special considerations for review as human subjects, animal use, proprietary data, and hazardous materials. Negotiating and Accepting Awards OSPR negotiates terms and conditions for all awards and subawards with sponsors to ensure a mutually acceptable award document. The office is also primarily responsible for negotiating subawards to institutions when Clark is the primary recipient of a grant or contract. Non-Financial Post-Award Administration The Office has several post-award responsibilities, including approvals for rebudgeting and no-cost extensions, resolving administrative problems that may arise during the course of a project, and overseeing non-financial reporting on sponsored projects. OSPR also works closely with Grant Accounting to ensure that the financial management of awards meets both Clark and sponsor requirements. Additional Services In addition to the above services, OSPR: Organizes campus informational meetings on grant writing, funding opportunities, using electronic grant-related resources, grant management issues, and other topics germane to sponsored program activity at Clark. Maintains a grants management database that can provide members of the university community with timely information pertaining to sponsored program activity at Clark.

Outlined below are phases for developing a proposal, resources for information about funding, and other tools available to grant writers. Also check out tips and best practices for ensuring a competitive proposals. Underlined terms in this Guide are hyperlinked to pages containing more detailed information. Proposal Development Guide Tips for Writing a Successful Proposal Research Thoroughly: Understand the funder’s guideline, priorities, and requirements. Tailor your proposal to align with their specific objectives. Clarity and Conciseness: Write clearly and concisely. Avoid jargon and technical language when possible. Clearly explain complex ideas. Strong Rationale: Provide a compelling reason for your project. Explain the problem you’re addressing and why it matters. Use data and evidence to support your claims. Realistic Goals: Set achievable goals and objectives. Unrealistic expectations can harm your proposal’s credibility. Engage the Reader: Make your proposal engaging. Use visuals, stories, and testimonials where applicable to illustrate your point. Proofread and Edit: Eliminate grammatical errors and inconsistencies. A polished proposal demonstrates professionalism and attention to detail. Follow Instructions: Adhere to the funder’s guideline meticulously. Include all required documents and information. Developing Good Ideas The central dogma of grantsmanship is that a good proposal begins with a good idea. At the same time, the axiom that “the best writing can’t turn a bad idea into a good grant proposal, but bad writing can turn a good idea into an unfunded proposal,” also holds. A good idea combined with clear expository writing in a proposal does not guarantee funding, but it certainly greatly enhances the prospects you will be successful. Sources of grant writing tips, and other assistance for writing proposals are readily available. Consider attending a grant writing workshop, or a course on technical writing to brush up your skills, if necessary. The Office of Sponsored Programs and Research organizes such efforts, or can facilitate your placement in a program offered by another institution. It can also provide you with advice on writing for specific funding agencies. Developing a good idea is a somewhat different challenge. The lack of one is the primary reason applications are rejected. So how does one develop a compelling, novel idea? While there is no formula for success, an iterative process can help to organize, a daunting challenge, into manageable tasks: The first is to identify a specific problem you want to solve. This is usually nested in a more general area of interest you have, and forms a step along a continuum of investigative activity you wish to pursue. A second task is to undertake a thorough literature review of the area in which you are interested. The review should provide insight into what is known and not known about the problem you want to investigate. Obviously, you want to identify the knowledge gap, and the idea you have to fill it. As you proceed, working ideas you had about your intended project will almost certainly change, and in some instances, be discarded. Eventually, the play between your ideas, and current and past knowledge of the field should yield the connections you need to move forward. If it does not, you need to continue the process, or strongly consider abandoning the line of inquiry for a different one. After you develop a working idea for your project, its feasibility needs to be determined. This, in part, requires a hard-eyed appraisal of your ability to carry out the project. For example, do you have the time, expertise, and resources at your disposable to pursue the work which it will require? If it requires quantitative or language skills, for instance, are you up to the challenge? You must also know what the competition is like. Is it possible that recent work in the field parallels yours, so that by the time your project is completed, it will be yesterday’s news? Finally, you must ascertain whether the idea has funding potential. For some ideas, investigatory costs are minimal, but for others, the feasibility of moving ahead very much hinges on the ability to attract support from a sponsor. OSPR is an excellent source of counseling on funding needs. Advice from colleagues is another component in the process of developing a good idea. The formative process of concertizing a good idea can be isolating. Therefore, it is necessary to reach out to others for the constructive criticism which can test whether the idea you have can stand up to the cold light of day. Colleagues, who work in the same field in which your idea is rooted, are best equipped to offer sound critiques. Certainly, at least one individual should be very closely identified with your area of expertise. In addition to close professional colleagues, you can sound out those with a more “generalist” understanding of your field as well. Once you have obtained feedback from colleagues, it is time for you to determine whether to refine the idea, stand fast, or discard it. If you decide to go forward, you must have total confidence in what you will propose to sponsors, that it meets the very highest standards of scholarship, and merits funding. Proposal Writing Regardless of the sponsor, proposals tend to be comprised of several components, which together, should form a seamless whole to make a convincing case for project funding. Some grantors, such as NIH, seek proposals that require an exhaustive amount of information. Others, particularly private sponsors, may require very brief proposals that run only a few pages. Nevertheless, most funders, in one form or another, require the applicant to provide a summary statement, a capabilities section, a problem statement, a statement of objectives, a description of the methodology, or activities to be undertaken, and a budget. These elements may be compressed into fewer (or more) sections, have different titles, or are required in a different sequences. However, they represent the generic components of a proposal. The summary statement, or executive summary, or abstract, or project summary provides reviewers with their first impression of what you propose. Too often, it is written as an afterthought, rather than crafted to elicit the best possible reaction from the reviewer. A poorly conceived summary statement can bias the reader against the rest of your proposal. In some cases, it may be the first, and last section of the proposal that is read. This section is best understood as a welcome mat where you first engage the reviewer. Another element of a proposal is the introduction in which the applicant can lay the foundation as to why the individual, or team, is best suited to undertake this work. Sometimes this information is placed in a section called the bio-sketch. Regardless, the objective of this part of the narrative is to provide reviewers with an understanding of who you are, and to establish your credibility to carry out the work. The needs, or problem statement, or central hypothesis component of the proposal conveys the significance of the problem to be addressed. This is the part which provides a focus to your proposal. The importance of the project must not be regarded as self-evident. The narrative should clearly define what the problem is, and why it is worth solving. Too broad a problem statement can make the investigator appear as if the agency is being asked to support a fishing expedition. Too narrow a problem raises the question as to why funds should be allocated for a trivial pursuit. The objectives section details what the investigator expects to accomplish, that is the outcome, product, or service, attendant with the need statement, or central hypothesis. A cardinal rule, when formulating your objectives, is the more specific they are, the better. Whenever possible, provide a metric that allows project results to be measured. A methodology, or activities unit provides the reviewer with a nuts and bolts view as to how the project is to be done. It should flow from the objectives statement you provided. The basic requirements of this section are clarity and justification. You need to provide a rationale, for example, as to why you have chosen qualitative methods for your inquiry, or why a particular statistical test has been selected. Finally, you must include a budget, and often, a narrative budget justification. A budget is a numerical expression of your work plan, not numbers pulled from thin air. All too often, the budget is the next-to-the-last (after the project summary) part of a proposal to be done. In the last-minute rush of proposal preparation, the budget is slapped together using figures that bear little relation to the tasks enumerated in the project narrative. Reviewers, however, are often very cognizant of costs, being investigators themselves, and know what an appropriate budget should look like. A poorly constructed budget can reflect as poorly on the overall submission as an ill-conceived section on objectives or methodology. The key to a good budget is not to skimp, so not jeopardize the viability of completing the project, nor to be greedy by padding it with extraneous items. Ask for what you need. Funding for Sponsored Programs Finding support for your application constitutes a critical step in moving from an idea to a proposal to a project. The objective is to locate a cohort of sponsors with interests that closely match the work you wish to do. Resist the temptation to tailor your interests to the availability of funds. In the end, your passion for a project, which you have defined, will be far more sustaining than one developed out of sense of expediency. In the search for appropriate sponsors, you will need to scrutinize the funding environment. Is the sponsor really interested in your area of interest? An agency program announcement may nominally appear to be a good fit, but on closer investigation, is understood to focus on a limited number of priorities areas, under which your study does not really fit. The range of funding available is another consideration. You need to ascertain the costs of completing your work. If the funding range is too low, you may be unable to undertake the project you propose, have to downsize the scope of work, or seek additional support from another source. A funding range that exceeds your needs suggests that the sponsor is looking for projects more ambitious than the one you are proposing. You also want to determine the ratio of applications to awards. A success rate in the single digits, within a given program, indicates chances for obtaining an award are small, and the work involved in making an application may not be worth the time and effort. Success rates, however, should not be the sole criteria for deciding whether or not to apply. The quality of your idea, your writing, and the fit with agency guidelines may prove irresistible to the sponsor. Locating potential sponsors is multifaceted . A good starting point is to utilize both proprietary, such as Pivot-RP, and non-proprietary grant information databases which allow you to run funding searches based on a number of fields that can be tailored to specific needs. Networking with colleagues, scrutinizing professional publications and websites in your field, and attending professional meetings at which agency officials often appear is another valuable way to identify the universe of appropriate funding organizations to which you may apply. Working with OSPR and Corporate and Foundation Relations staff should also be an important part of your overall funding strategy. OSPR can assist you in setting up funding alerts to receive targeted, e-mail notices of funding opportunities as soon as they are announced, furnish other funding information germane to your interests, and provide strategic assistance on working with program officers within funding agencies. Corporate and Foundation Relations can introduce you to informational sources on private funding including The Foundation Center. Once you have identified a cohort of funding agencies, and obtained all the necessary guidelines, program announcements, and information, read the material CAREFULLY to determine which ones seem most likely to be receptive to your funding idea. Work with professional and administrative colleagues for assistance in refining your choices. Remember, most often, you will want to apply to more than one funding source, simply because the probabilities of success at any one sponsor are not favorable. In all likelihood, this will require slightly different proposals, using the novel, compelling idea you developed, to accord with the funding guidelines for individual sponsors.

What is the process for the preparation, review, and approval of proposal for funding form external sources? Once notified of an intent to submit a grant application, OSPR and/or CFR will coordinate a Pre-Proposal Meeting with the Principal Investigator or Program Manager and appropriate support staff. The purpose of the meeting is to clarify the submission process and timeline, proposal-specific requirements, budget limits, and to help identify potential items to address early in the review process. Internal Clark Proposal Forms A Clark University Proposal Summary & Approval Form must accompany each proposal when submitted for review to OSPR. An Instruction Sheet is available to assist in filling out the form. This form documents approval of the project by key administrators (Department Chair, Institute Director, Director of Corporate and Foundation Relations (when applicable), Director and Assistant Director of OSPR, and the Dean of Research. Their approval attests to the project’s compliance with university and sponsor guidelines. It is very important that all items on the approval form be completed. Prospective principal investigators or project directors should pay especially close attention to Part IV, Compliance Considerations, and Part V, Institutional Considerations. The information provided here informs the University of any special conditions attached to the project such as human subjects, hazardous materials, or space needs. The Clark University Proposal Summary & Approval Form should be used for all sponsored projects that are new, continuations, renewals, resubmissions, supplements, or amendments. Reviews and Approvals Proposals are reviewed by the 1) Department Chair or Institute Director, 2) the Director of Foundation and Corporate Relations (where applicable), 3) the Assistant Director of Sponsored Programs and Research, 4) Director of Sponsored Programs and Research, and 5) the Dean of Research, in that order. There may be the need for other approvals depending on the specific proposal request, such as additional space or renovations, course buyouts, potential conflicts of interest. By endorsing the Form, signatories certify that the respective campus offices assume responsibility for commitment of resources or persons under their jurisdiction as indicated by the proposal.

Because these represent “pooled” or average costs, it is difficult to find an exact correspondence between the administrative expenses of a project, and the actual charges applied to it. It would be difficult, for example, to identify campus security costs, or library operating expenses associated with the life of a particular project. Because indirect costs necessarily reflect an averaging of administrative expenses, some projects will cost the University more in overhead than will be received in reimbursement from supporting agencies; conversely, other projects will receive more for indirect costs, than they will actually require. It is imperative that appropriate administrative overhead rates be applied to proposed projects. Income lost due to under-recovery of indirect costs can never be recaptured. This, in turn, undercuts the University’s efforts to maintain and improve support services for sponsored projects. When budgeting indirect costs for grants, it is useful to remember that projects are NOT rejected on the basis of these expenses. Applying negotiated rates to federal projects is not only appropriate, but expected. If the technical aspects of a proposal are well-received, agencies will negotiate budget reductions, if they consider the request to be excessive. It should be noted that the Principal Investigator or Project Director is NOT authorized to negotiate indirect costs recovery on behalf of Clark with sponsoring organizations, public or private. This is the responsibility of OSPR personnel. The “rulebook” governing indirect costs is the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) Circular A-21, “The Federal Cost Principles Applicable to Educational Institutions.” While universities individually negotiate their indirect cost rates with their particular cognizant agency, A-21 specifies the basis for determining those costs. Clark University’s indirect cost rates are comprised of three major categories: Facility-related costs, service-related costs, and administrative costs. Clark University’s Current Indirect Cost Rates (effective 6/1/22 – 5/31/26)50.3% for on-campus projects20.7% for off-campus projects What makes up Clark University’s Indirect Cost Rate? Facility-related Costs Facility-related costs are comprised of the following: Building Depreciation – Clark, like many other institutions, calculates annual depreciation expenses as part of its indirect costs in an effort to associate the cost of facilities with the users of those facilities. Equipment Depreciation – Since federally-funded activities benefit from the use of Clark-funded equipment, depreciation on this contribution is calculated annually on all items valued over $5,000 that have been purchased with non-federal monies. Interest Expenses – Some Clark facilities have been constructed with funds provided through the issuance of debt. The cost of this debt is the interest portion of annual debt service payments made to our creditors. Occupants of facilities, which were debt financed, including federally-funded research projects, are assessed their share of this interest expense. Operations and Maintenance – These costs include the expenses incurred, usually Physical Plant department for the administration, supervision, operation, preservation, and protection of the University’s physical facilities. Examples of this category of costs include custodial services, repair and maintenance, grounds care, energy expenses, maintenance supplies, campus security and property management. Service-related Costs The service-related component of indirect costs is comprised of one item: Library – This includes the total operating costs of the University library for books and library materials Administrative Costs The third part of indirect costs is comprised of three administrative pools: General Administration – This covers the costs of operations of executive and administrative offices such as human resources, general accounting, payroll, purchasing, legal counsel, and the Office of the President. Department Administration – This expense includes administrative and supporting services that benefit departmental activities such as dean’s office, academic department heads, and departmental support services. No more than twenty percent of salary can be charged to department administration. Sponsored Programs Administration – The activities in this pool exist primarily to administer and service sponsored projects. This includes expenses associated with the Office of Sponsored Programs and Research, Grant Accounting, and other costs related to health and safety issues of research.

Appropriation The sum of money that the Congress decides should be devoted to a specific purpose in a given fiscal year (usually much less than the authorization). Authorization The amount of money that could be spent for a program that has been legislated. Authorized Organization Representative (AOR) A member of the organization authorized to submit applications in Grants.gov or other federal agency submission portals on behalf of the organization. Award Financial assistance that provides support or stimulation to accomplish a public purpose. Awards include grants and other agreements in the form of money or property in lieu of money, by the federal government to an eligible recipient. Bidders/Offerors Conference A meeting between representatives of institutions interested in responding to a request for proposal (RFP) and agency representatives, who provide background information about the RFP, and answer questions. Budget A management plan for a project, expressed in financial terms. Categorical Grants Funds restricted to a certain category of interests, such as child-care, or services for the handicapped. Continuation Funding A non-competing request for additional funding. Contract The instrument for support an activity that is initiated by the funder such as a government agency or a foundation. The activity performs a specified service or will yield a particular end or product for the sponsor. The funding agency exercises considerable direction and control over the performance and timing of the work. Cooperative Agreements Undertakings in which research and training projects are jointly administered by the funding agency, and the recipient institution. The institution has less discretion over the scope and direction of work than in a grant, and more than in a contract. Cost-Sharing The difference between the amount of funding needed to complete a sponsored project, and what the sponsor is willing to provide. Cost-sharing can be either in direct costs, or indirect costs. Deadline A fixed date by which a proposal must be either sent or received by the sponsoring agency. Instructions regarding deadlines should be read carefully. Some agencies require a proposal to be submitted and received by a certain date and time. Direct Costs Costs that are easily identified and charged to a specific project. These may include such items as salaries and wages, travel, equipment, and supplies. Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Procurement regulations which govern the terms and conditions of federal contracts (not grants). These regulations are subject to negotiation as certain provisions in a contract may not be compatible with university practices. Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) A publicly available document by which a federal agency makes know its intentions to award discretionary grants or cooperative agreements. FOAs may be known as program announcements, notices of funding availability, solicitations, and other names depending on the agency or program type. Grant The instrument for providing financial assistance support for an activity initiated by the applicant, that falls within the guidelines and priorities of the funding agencies. Indirect Costs Costs incurred for common or joint objectives which cannot, therefore, be readily identified with a specific project. Typical indirect costs include library expenses, depreciation, plant operation and maintenance, and administration. Learn More Matching Funds Funding contributed by the recipient institution that is mandated by the sponsor to match its contribution in support of a project. Matching fund requirements can often involve multiples of the amount provided, that is the awardee must provide two or three times – or more – of the amount awarded. Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) A notice of funding opportunity is any paper or electronic issuance that an agency uses to announce a funding opportunity, whether it is called a “program announcement,” “notice of funding availability,” “broad agency announcement,” “research announcement,” “solicitation,” or some other term. Planning Grant Funds allocated to support planning, and developing the means for carrying out the project. Often a planning grant will include the resources necessary to write a proposal for funding the project itself. Principal Investigator The person who has overall responsibility for carrying out the project. There can only be one principal investigator, but there can be several co-principal investigators. Program Income Program income means gross income earned by the non-Federal entity that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award during the period of performance. Project Period The period established in the award document during which awarding agency sponsorship begins and ends. Renewal A competing continuation request for funding. Renewals generally include new work based on the results of the existing grant and are subject to peer review. Resubmission An effort to secure funding for a proposal that has been revised in response to critical comments from reviewers. Solicited Proposal Submitted in response to a request by a sponsor for a specific research or educational project. Often solicited proposals are found in Requests for Proposals (RFP). A Request for Application is a solicitation for investigators who are interested in working with the agency to collaborate with the funding agency to design and carry out a specific project. Subaward An award provided by a pass-through entity to a subrecipient for the subrecipient to carry out part of a Federal award received by the pass-through entity. It does not include payments to a contractor or payments to an individual that is a beneficiary of a Federal program. A subaward may be provided through any form of legal agreement, including an agreement that the pass-through entity considers a contract. Subrecipient A non-Federal entity that receives a subaward from a pass-through entity to carry out part of a Federal program; but does not include an individual that is a beneficiary of such program. A subrecipient may also be a recipient of other Federal awards directly from a Federal awarding agency. Supplement A request to a sponsor for additional funds for an existing project to cover unanticipated expenses. Target Date The date by which an agency must receive a proposal in order for it to be reviewed for a given funding cycle. If the proposal fails to arrive at the agency by the target date, it is moved for consideration to the next funding cycle. In contrast, an proposal which fails to meet an agency deadline, receives no further consideration. Under-Recovery The difference between what the University should obtain in indirect if the appropriate rate is applied, and what it actually will receive from the sponsoring agency. Unsolicited Proposal A submission based on the subjects of interest to investigators in the field rather than to the agency.

Faculty Development Fund Procedures Forms and Agreements Info For Research Participation System SONA Login About Us Leadership and Staff Grants and Contracts Proposal Guide Proposal Tools Data About Clark Indirect Costs Recent Grants and Contracts Glossary FAQs IRB/Human Subjects Funding Opportunities Faculty Development Fund Procedures Forms and Agreements Frequently Asked Questions Home Grants and Contracts Frequently Asked Questions Have a question about external funding? What offices on campus are responsible for external funding requests? Two offices on campus are responsible for the review and approval of external funding requests, also known as grant proposals, agreements or contracts: the Office of Sponsored Programs and Research (OSPR), and Corporate & Foundation Relations (CFR) within University Advancement. The former is responsible for approving ALL non-gift external funding requests; in addition, the latter is responsible for approving both gift and non-gift external funding requests to private sponsors, i.e. corporations, foundations and non-government organizations. What is the difference between University Advancement and the Office of Sponsored Programs and Research? University Advancement is responsible for charitable gifts to Clark. Such gifts help fund a wide range of needs such as scholarships, endowed chairs, new facilities and other areas, including research, critical to the University’s mission. Most contributions obtained by Advancement are in the form of gifts. However, some contributions from private sources (corporations, foundations, or non-government organizations) are for sponsored programs and require the same review process as funding requests made to public sponsors (federal, state and local governments, and government agencies). OSPR is responsible for the review and submission of external funding requests as well as the acceptance of external funding for all university based research, educational, training and other projects for which the sponsors mandate terms and conditions in return for their financial support. Exactly what is a sponsored program? A sponsored program is an activity which receives external support that carries with it conditions regarding the expenditure of funds, such as requiring a tangible (e.g. a written report) or intangible end product, or obligating the University to return support if project objectives are not realized. In contrast, a gift is support which has no stipulations of this kind and can be used by the institution as agreed upon with the donor. If I am considering preparing a request for external funding for submission through the University, who should I contact and when? If your request will be sent to a public sponsor, contact OSPR to get guidance. If your request will be sent to a private sponsor, contact CFR to get guidance. Both should be contacted as early as possible in the process. Staff in both offices can answer questions, provide advice and refer you to other university resources for assistance. Once a proposal is ready and has been reviewed and approved by your supervisor, it should be submitted, along with a signed Proposal Summary and Approval Form and all supporting materials, to either OSPR or CFR (depending on the type of sponsor). The Dean of Research should be directly contacted well in advance of the submission deadline when a project involves institutional issues such as cost-sharing, new programs, leaves of absence and/or course buyouts. Contact with the Dean is best handled through OSPR. Do I need to check with anyone before I send my proposal to OSPR or CFR for review? Yes. Your department chair, director or administrative supervisor must be aware of your plans to pursue external funding and approve of the activities that the funding will support. Thus, before submitting your external funding request to either OSPR or CFR for internal review and approval, your department chair, director or the person to whom you directly report will need to review your funding request and sign the Proposal Summary and Approval Form. We recommend that you touch base with this person early in the process as well. Do letters of inquiry or pre-proposals require internal review and approval? Yes, particularly if there is a preliminary budget required as part of the pre-proposal. In addition, many private sponsors only allow one proposal per institution, so CFR needs to make sure that multiple inquiries are not being submitted in these cases. How long does the internal review and approval process take? You should allow five business days for OSPR review and approval of your request. For private sponsors, CFR requires five business days for review and approval in addition to OSPR’s five days. In other words, proposals with specific submission deadlines should be submitted for internal review: to OSPR at least one week prior to deadline for public sponsors; or to CFR at least two weeks prior to deadline for private sponsors. In order to expedite the review and approval process, proposals should be in final, or close to final, form when submitted for internal review and all items being submitted should be included. If you are planning an electronic submission through NIH or grants.gov, additional lead time is strongly encouraged. Can campus units (centers, schools or departments) submit grant proposals on which they are the applicant organization? No. Clark is the legal entity that is applying for funding and to which a grant award is made. Accordingly, basic organizational information is available on the OSPR web site for inclusion in proposals. Institutional attachments, such as Clark’s IRS letter of determination, audited financial statements, list of trustees, operating budget, or other often-requested documents are available from OSPR or CFR. Because private sponsors sometimes ask for institutional information that must be compiled from multiple sources, CFR requires ample lead time to provide such information. Please provide a list of all required institutional attachments as early as possible in the application process. Can individual faculty or staff submit grant proposals independent of the University? Sometimes. Grants and contracts are typically awarded to the institution, on behalf of faculty and staff. However, some awards are made directly to individuals. If the University will be administering and reporting on the grant, it must be submitted via the processes described here. If an individual will be receiving an award directly and is responsible for its administration, that application would not go through the University. Note that awards made to individuals may have tax implications, so it is advisable to consult with an accountant or attorney in these cases. Do I need to include indirect costs on every proposal I submit through the University? Yes. In certain cases, sponsors may provide either no administrative overhead reimbursement or only a fraction of what Clark’s negotiated agreement for indirect costs allows. It is important to determine the percentage of indirect costs permitted by the sponsor and to apply it to your budget. The difference between what the sponsor is willing to provide and what the university requires is considered “cost-sharing.” Before a proposal is submitted, cost-sharing must be approved by the Dean of Research as the University must understand its financial obligations toward the project. If the agency includes information in their guidelines concerning the payment of indirect costs, please include a copy of this with your supporting materials as this will speed up the review process. Learn more about indirect costs How do I decide whether to use the on-campus or off-campus indirect cost rate? The appropriate indirect cost rate to apply is determined by where the preponderance of project work is to be done. If, for example, 51% or more of the work plan is undertaken on campus, then the on-campus rate should be used. Conducting fieldwork or using off-campus facilities for short-term project-related activity does not qualify for the off-campus rate. Utilizing the on- and off-campus rates for different line items within the same project budget is not permitted per the federal Office of Management and Budget (see OMB Circular A-21, Cost Principles for Educational Institutions). Thus, there can be no “blended” rates. Learn more about indirect costs Can I receive salary from an external funding source? In some cases, yes. Faculty or staff with 9- or 10-month appointments or otherwise working part-time can receive salary support, but this means different things to different sponsors. NIH, for example, allows investigators or project directors to receive three months of summer salary. NSF only permits two months. The best advice is to check the grant guidelines and follow up with the sponsor if needed. Faculty or staff with 12-month appointments cannot receive additional compensation from external funding sources. Fringe benefits must be calculated and included in your budget if you are requesting salary support. Can I request funding for a course buyout in my proposal? Faculty interested in a course buyout in their grant or sponsored program proposal should contact OSPR as soon as possible to discuss the budgetary and approval requirements. After that discussion it will be necessary to gain approval from the department chair, the Associate Provost for Faculty Affairs (for early career faculty), and the Dean of Research. This must all be done well in advance of the grant submission. How do I calculate the funding for a course buyout? Add one-eighth of your academic year salary to one-eighth of your fringe benefits for the total. For a 9-month academic year salary, a course buyout is the equivalent of 1.125 months. I need to submit a proposal electronically through grants.gov. Is Clark registered with grants.gov, and who do I contact if I need to be set up in the agency’s system? Yes, Clark is registered with grants.gov and OSPR is responsible for providing the necessary information for electronic submission through this web portal. Please allow extra time for these submissions (at least 2-3 weeks ahead of the submission deadline). What if I am offered an opportunity by colleagues at another institution or organization to participate in a project (i.e., receive a sub-award) – what should I do? Working on a project funded by an outside agency to another college or university is, in principle, no different from applying directly to a sponsor for external funding. OSPR or CFR should be contacted soon after it is clear that an application will be made by the collaborating institution. In effect, you are applying to the lead university to fund your research, program or project. You must provide it with a description of the work you propose and a budget which includes the appropriate direct and indirect costs. This information needs to be reviewed and approved, just like any other external funding request, PRIOR to submission of the application by the lead institution. If the proposal is successful, the lead institution will make an award to Clark in the form of a subcontract or sub-grant which contains the same terms and conditions to which it is bound. Learn more about indirect costs What if I want Clark to be the lead institution for an application involving another university or organization? Collaborative proposals in which Clark is the lead institution usually require more lead time than other funding requests. It is important to contact OSPR so it can establish ties with appropriate administrative officials at participating universities and/or other participating organizations. Before a proposal can be sent to a sponsor, it is critical that Clark receive permission from an authorizing official from each of the collaborating institutions. Keep in mind that budgets involving sub-awards have limitations on the indirect costs allowed. Contact OSPR for assistance with any budgets that contain sub-awards. Learn more about indirect costs Can I sign agreements with sponsors when I receive external funding? Not in the case of institutional awards. In these cases, agreements accompanying an award need to be signed by an authorizing official in Clark’s administration. (Sometimes sponsors provide a space where both the project director or principal investigator and an authorizing official can co-sign such documents.) Clark’s “authorizing official” is designated as the Dean of Research. Accordingly, all institutional award letters from public sponsors should be forwarded to OSPR when received to ensure proper recording and processing. All private sponsor award letters and accompanying materials, including the mailing envelope, should be date-stamped and forwarded to CFR. Where do I send any award checks sent directly to me? Please send public sponsor checks directly to grants accounting. Please send private sponsor checks, along with award letters and all accompanying materials, including the mailing envelope date-stamped to indicate when received, to CFR. What if I leave Clark? Can I take my project with me? For the vast majority of sponsored projects, faculty can transfer grants when they are the principal investigator or project director. However, institutional grants which have been awarded to Clark in support of a program or some other general purpose remain with the University. What if I am not interested in outside funding for my research? Why should I write a grant? Funds from sponsors can be awarded for many purposes other than research. Support for conferences, travel and curriculum development are just a few of the categories funded by external agencies. I have not had an active research program for many years, and would now like to renew my efforts. Is there support for someone like me? Depending on the research focus, there are sponsors that have programs designed to provide support for researchers who, for a variety of reasons, have been inactive for a considerable time or who have made a sea-change in their interests and wish to work in a new field. Aren’t most funding organizations controlled by “old boy” networks, making it difficult for newcomers to secure awards? There is no substitute for experience and a demonstrated record of success in a given area to enhance the chances of being funded. However, many sponsors have programs specifically set aside to support new or young investigators. Public sponsors, in particular, tend to maintain a level playing field and fund according to the quality of the proposal rather than the reputation of the applicant. What resources are available to me? OSPR’s website, contains proposal preparation tips and research tools to assist you if you choose to look for external funding. It also contains institutional information often requested by sponsors as well as internal forms and instructions. Once you have completed your preliminary research on possible funding sources, Corporate and Foundation Relations can help with additional research on private sponsors using their online subscription services. In addition, CFR notifies various departments on campus when they identify funding opportunities that may be of interest to faculty and staff. Proposal preparation is primarily the responsibility of the person seeking funding. CFR assists with proposal preparation for institutional and departmental requests to private sponsors that align with Clark’s strategic priorities. For additional information, contact Jennifer Hitt, Director of CFR. For post-award grant administration information, visit Grants Accounting. OSPR works closely with Grant Accounting throughout the post-award process.

All human subjects research at Clark must be reviewed by the IRB. General Overview Application forms and instructions may be found on the Mentor IRB Website. Exempt and expedited reviews are generally considered on a rolling basis. For other types of research, submission deadlines for monthly IRB meetings are listed on the sidebar. Apart from situations in which urgent review is required due to extenuating circumstances, the IRB does not review applications during the summer. Turnaround time for proposal review is normally 1-3 weeks after submission (for exempt or expedited reviews) or 1-2 weeks after the meeting date (for full board reviews). An additional week is sometimes needed for special circumstances. Note that there are submission deadline dates for each scheduled IRB meeting. The point of contact for IRB matters is Linda Cote, Grant and IRB Coordinator, at licote@clarku.edu. NOTE: Some committee determinations may require review of a revised proposal at a subsequent meeting of the full committee. It is strongly urged that research planned for summer be submitted for review NO LATER THAN APRIL to allow time for resubmission if required. Proposals submitted for the final (May) meeting of the academic year are rarely approved in time for research to take place over the summer. CITI Training All individuals submitting proposals to the IRB must have completed CITI training. Training must be renewed every three years. Mentor will automatically flag your submission if your training has expired. CITI training must include the “RCR Basic Curriculum + Human Subjects” modules.

This may include “seed money” for new research initiatives to help obtain results or confirm ideas that can become part of a research proposal to an outside granting agency, and also can be used for other scholarly projects and creative endeavors that hold promise to raise the visibility and reputation of the institution. This fund is restricted to faculty holding Regular Faculty Appointments (Faculty Handbook page 2, category D. 1) and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty Appointments defined as Open-ended Term Appointments, including Lectureships, Professors of Practice and Full-time Research Professorships (category D. 2. b) [see faculty handbook pages 2 and 3 for details on the nature of these appointments]. Guidelines for Faculty Development Fund Proposals(Spring 2025 – February 3, 2025 Deadline) Awards will be determined based on the quality of the proposal and the funds available. The maximum budget allowed is $5,000 for an individual and $7,500 for a collaborative proposal. Funds have been made available from the Dean of Research’s Matching Research Fund and the Larry Fechter and Thomas Macke Stansbury gift. notice of submission form Application Guidelines Applications should be brief (limit: 3 typed pages) and should include: A description of the proposed activity that explains its significance for: How this project fits into your professional development to date, and how it moves you toward the next stage of your career at Clark. Capacity of the activity to generate additional resources through subsequent external funding and/or to complete a major scholarly or creative project. If there are specific challenges or complexities to completing this work (e.g., DEI-intensive work, community-engaged scholarship, and interdisciplinary and/or collaborative projects), please address those in the proposal and how the funding will help. The description of the proposed activity should be written in plain language, free of jargon (or clearly explained when it is necessary to use specialized terminology), for an educated audience of non-specialist peers. Because the proposal will be reviewed by individuals who are likely to have no specialized knowledge of an applicant’s area of study, applicants should describe the significance of the activity in non-technical terms that are not specific to the researcher’s discipline. A paragraph explaining the outcome of previous FDF grants (only for faculty who have received an award from this fund in the past). An itemized budget and justification. If you still have a start-up fund balance or an external grant, provide an explanation for why you cannot use those funds for the proposed project. Please share if you have applied for alternative funding for the proposed project. A current CV Late submissions will not be considered. Evaluation Criteria Evaluation criteria include: The role of the activity in individual faculty development Capacity of the activity to generate additional resources through subsequent external funding and/or to complete scholarly or creative project How work contributes to a faculty member’s respective field Feasibility of the activity with respect to its stated goals and objectives Additionally, where appropriate and relevant, the Board will consider DEI efforts, community-engaged scholarship, engagement with students, and interdisciplinary and/or collaborative projects. The application must be accompanied by a properly endorsed Notice of Submission Form (see link below). Funds in this program will not be available for salary supplementation, but can be used to support student research assistants. If student support is requested, specify precisely what the student will do in support of the proposed activity. Student fringe benefits must be included in the budget request (student fringe (9.7%) is only added in summer). Title to equipment purchased with Faculty Development funds rests with the University.

Principal Investigators (PIs) are responsible for financial oversight of their grants and contracts to ensure that all charges conform to the requirements of the OMB, as well as any and all requirements, terms, and conditions of the funder and project award. Grant Accounting and OSPR provide additional oversight and support and should be contacted at any point with questions on the financial management of awards. PIs can also refer to OSPR’s internal Post-award Checklist to help manage award expenditures and other requirements of a sponsored project. Determining Allowable Costs Determining Allowable Costs OMB Circular A-21 (Cost Principles for Educational Institutions) establishes the principles for determining what costs are properly applicable to grants, contracts and other agreements with educational institutions. According to OMB Circular A-21 all costs must be: Allowable under the terms of the grant/contract. To be allowable, costs must be: Reasonable, Allocable to the sponsored agreement, Given consistent treatment under accounting principles, and Conform to limitations or exclusions set forth in A-21 or in the sponsored agreement. Reasonable. PIs should consider the following guidelines for determining reasonableness: The actions taken to incur the expense reflect those of a prudent person in those circumstances. The cost is recognized as necessary for the operation of the institution or the carrying out of the sponsored project. The persons incurring the expense acted prudently and with consideration of their responsibilities to their institution, its employees, its students, the Federal Government, and the public at large. The actions taken to incur the expense are consistent with institutional policies and practices applicable to the work of the institution generally, including sponsored projects. Allocable. A cost is allocable to a sponsored project if: It solely advances the work under the sponsored agreement, or It benefits both the sponsored agreement and other institutional work in proportions that can be reasonably approximated, or It is necessary to the overall operation of the institution and is deemed allocable in part to sponsored projects in light of OMB principles. Additional rules regarding allocable costs include: If a cost benefits two or more projects in proportions that can be determined, the cost should be allocated to the projects based on proportional benefit. If these proportions cannot be determined, then the costs may be allocated or transferred to benefited projects on a reasonable basis consistent with the principles of OMB Circular A-21. Unallowable Costs Unallowable Costs OMB Circular A-21 describes costs that are not normally allowable for reimbursement (unallowable costs). Unallowable costs cannot be charged to sponsored agreements. The following are some of the cost categories that are unallowable under A-21: Alcohol Entertainment including luncheons, dinners, banquets, flowers, and decorations for an event Certain Memberships and Subscriptions Advertising, Public Relations, and Fund Raising (unless advertising for a required position for a research grant) Losses on Other Sponsored Agreements or Contracts Proposal Costs OMB Circular A-21 provides full explanations on these and other cost categories. OSPR and Grant Accounting can provide further guidance as well and should be contacted directly with any questions on allowable or unallowable costs. Approval of Award Expenditures Approval of Award Expenditures The PI is responsible for developing and reviewing their funding budget proposal to conform with agency and award guidelines; OSPR and the Dean of Research review and approve all proposals, including proposed budgets, prior to submission. Once the University accepts an award, OSPR works with the PI and Department staff to finalize agreements, subcontracts, and budget line items in accordance with the approved award. This includes identifying Authorized Signatories for grant-related expenses. The PI may assign some of the duties associated with the financial management of their award to an appropriate person in their department by adding them as an authorized signatory, but primary oversight responsibility remains with the PI. OSPR then confirms all relevant documents have been finalized and sends them to Grant Accounting who establishes an account for the award in our financial system. Grant Accounting sends the PI notification of the account set-up with internal FUND and ACCOUNT numbers. Throughout the grant period, the PI is responsible for: Ensuring all disbursements are allowable and authorized under the terms of the award, OMB guidelines, University policies, and state and federal law; Charging expenses to the appropriate account and award; Spending according to their established budgets within the period of the award; Properly authorizing and documenting expenditures; Reviewing expenditures regularly, at least on a monthly basis, and taking immediate action to correct any errors; Updating the account with any changes in authorized signers or other award related changes; and Monitoring the financial performance of all subawards, including approving their invoices for payment. See Sub-Recipient/Sub-Award Monitoring policy for more details. Any payments/reimbursements made directly to the PI must be authorized by the Office of Sponsored Programs and Research.

It is the expectation of Clark University that Principal Investigators (PIs) understand the importance of regularly reviewing their research accounts and ensuring that allowable costs are initially charged to their appropriate funding sources. It is the PI’s responsibility to oversee the financial management of their project to avoid the need for cost transfers. However, in the cases where cost transfers become necessary, each one must be fully justified with appropriate documentation. Cost transfers typically may be necessary in the following cases: When an error occurred in the original charge including allocation to an inappropriate account or inappropriate allocation of an unallowable cost Where the cost benefits more than one sponsored agreement because the work is closely related such that the initial charge could have been made appropriately to the other sponsored account and the justification of the transfer is sufficient When pre-award spending appropriate under the guidelines of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-110 (Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Other Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Non-Profit Organizations) occurred and those costs need to be transferred to the sponsored account Cost transfers are never appropriate in the following circumstances: As a cost management strategy or for the convenience of the PI To avoid cost overruns or to use unspent funds When to do so would conflict with the procedures and guidelines established by the OMB and the funding agency Cost Transfer Policy and Procedures Cost Transfer Policy and Procedures All cost transfers of expenses and/or salaries should be completed immediately after the original transaction (when the charge was posted to the account), and are required to occur within 90 calendar days of the original transaction. The Journal Voucher Form should be completed and signed by the PI and forwarded to Grant Accounting. Answers to the following questions should be entered in the Explanation section of the Journal Voucher Form: Why was this expense originally charged to the account from which it is now being transferred? Why should this charge be transferred to the proposed receiving account? How was the error discovered? What is being done to prevent this from recurring? If this request is being made after the required 90 day window: Why is this cost transfer being requested more than 90 calendar days after the original transaction? Full explanations are required in the justification and statements such as “administrative oversight” or “did not know how to process the charges” should be avoided and may result in the denial of the transfer request. Departments may be held responsible for charges that are deemed unallowable or not allocable to the sponsored account. Cost transfers over 90 calendar days will be highly scrutinized and will require the approval of your Department Chair and the Dean of Research. In these cases, the Journal Voucher should be completed and sent with appropriate documentation to the Office of Sponsored Programs and Research (OSPR) for review and signature by the Dean of Research. Please note that salary cost transfers require OSPR approval and may require a recertification of the PI’s Time and Effort reporting. In these cases, the PI should contact OSPR for approval and to complete this recertification. Rationale for the Cost Transfer Policy and Procedures Rationale for the Cost Transfer Policy and Procedures Clark University is responsible for managing all funds in a manner consistent with the standards set by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), as well as with all applicable guidelines and policies set by the funders. Complete and timely execution and justification of cost transfers is required for direct costs to be considered both allowable and allocable under OMB Circular A-21 (Cost Principles for Educational Institutions). OMB A-21 also states that, “Any costs allocable to a particular sponsored agreement…may not be shifted to other sponsored agreements in order to meet deficiencies caused by overruns or other fund considerations, to avoid restrictions imposed by law or by terms of the sponsored agreement, or for other reasons of convenience.” Cost transfers are often reviewed by our auditors as well as by federal agency officials. Frequent, late and/or poorly justified cost transfers, as well as significant and questionable activity toward the end of an award period, could result in the denial of reimbursement and/or could bring the PI’s and the University’s compliance into question potentially putting the PI and/or the University at risk of administrative and/or financial sanction. Please address any questions on this policy and related procedures to the Office of Sponsored Programs and Research or Grants Accounting.

SFI/FCOI Review The Director of Sponsored Programs and Research is designated to review SFI disclosures. This person will determine if there is a FCOI because of an SFI that could directly and significantly affect the design, conduct, or reporting of externally funded research or other sponsored activities. FCOI Management When a FCOI is identified, the University will develop a management plan specifying the actions that will be taken to manage such FCOI.
