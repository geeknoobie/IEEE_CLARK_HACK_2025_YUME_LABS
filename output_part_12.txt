She focuses on the lived experience of illness and suffering as well as the intimate household politics of gender inequality and managing health and sickness in resource-constrained environments.

Most departments and offices at Clark hire students, but jobs — including federal work study jobs — are not guaranteed; they can be very competitive. Make sure you spend time writing your resume and cove letter to put your best foot forward. What new student employees need to know If you have never worked at Clark University, there are a few things to do before you apply for student jobs on campus or off. Bring Your IDs to Clark Log into Handshake Submit Your Timesheet How to find a job If you plan to apply for jobs, you need to start early — even before the semester begins. Jobs fill quickly, and you are not guaranteed an on-campus job even if you have been granted federal work study. Spring semester: Get ready in December and JanuaryFall semester: Get ready in July and August Log into Handshake: All on-campus employment positions are posted on Handshake, Clark’s job, internship, and volunteer opportunity portal. If you have not already done so, log onto Handshake using your Clark email address and password, and complete your profile. You will not be able to view or apply for on-campus employment without a Handshake account. “Follow” Clark University departments and offices to receive job notifications, and check back often, as more jobs are added daily. Work on your resume and cover letters: Resumes are required to apply for on-campus employment, and many on-campus positions also require a cover letter. Start working on your resume and cover letter(s) early to ensure you have enough time to complete your application materials. To get started, check out the template for your resume and the guide for your cover letter! Have your resume reviewed: If you are an undergraduate student, email the Career Lab and attach the document(s) you would like to have reviewed. If you are a graduate student, check with the career staff at your graduate school regarding options to have your documents reviewed. A special note for international students: Watch this video for job search strategies, including what a typical resume looks like in the United States, the importance of tailoring your cover letter, and best practices for your on-campus job search. The video also includes proper etiquette for the job search — for example, do not email or visit offices asking for consideration for on-campus jobs. Spring semester: Apply in January and FebruaryFall semester: Apply in August and September Search for off-campus jobs in Handshake: If you are a U.S. student, then consider searching in Handshake for jobs in the local community Search for on-campus jobs in Handshake: Because new positions are posted daily, check back often to find on-campus jobs that best fit your interests. To find on-campus jobs, go to the Jobs tab in Handshake, click the Filters button, and choose On Campus Student Employment. Then scroll down to check the box that says Employer Preferences Match. Apply to jobs: Submit your applications early, and apply to as many jobs as you are interested in. On-campus employment is very competitive, so don’t wait to apply. Many jobs are filled by the first week of classes. Review job restrictions: If you see a message saying “Your school has restricted your ability to apply to this job” or “Your school year does not match what is required for this job,” that means you are not eligible to apply to that job based on your school year or graduate school. The job description will list the school years desired for the position. Use the “Employer Preferences Match” filter. Wait for the hiring manager to contact you: If you are a final candidate for a position, be patient — a hiring manager will contact you to schedule an interview. In the meantime, keep applying to positions that interest you, and check your email often. Have questions? Review our Frequently Asked Questions See what other students have to say Federal Work-Study Jobs When you are awarded federal work study, you are not guaranteed a job; you must compete for an on-campus job with everyone else. Here are a few tips: Jobs are very competitive. Before applying to jobs, have your resume reviewed by uploading it to Handshake. In your cover letter, mention that you have federal work study so that the hiring manager is aware. Most on-campus jobs will not be tagged as work study, so apply to any on-campus job you’re interested in. If you’re hired, that will be your work study job. The Office of Community Engagement and Volunteering posts work-study jobs in the community; those are tagged as work study, and only work study students can apply. The applicant pool will be smaller, increasing your chances of getting hired. Check out our 11-minute Job Search Strategies for Students with Work Study video!

You will see that message if you do not meet the requirements of the position. Hiring managers set various preferences for their jobs and not all students will meet those preferences. We advise all students to use the filter “Matches all employer preferences” so they can easily see the jobs for which they are eligible. I have work study, how do I find a job? Read through the information and tips in the “Federal Work Study” section here! What types of jobs are there? There are many types of student employment opportunities, including as office assistants, proctors, and staff at the ITS Help Desk. The best way to learn about the many different positions being offered is to look through postings for open positions. Am I guaranteed a position? No. Positions are extremely competitive and hiring managers select the student they feel is the best fit for their needs. Using the proper job search strategies greatly increases your chances of getting hired. How do I view open positions? To find on-campus jobs, go to the Jobs tab in Handshake. Then click the Filters button and choose On Campus Student Employment. What if I don’t have a resume or need help updating it? If undergraduate students would like assistance with their resume or cover letter, they should make an appointment with the Career Lab team on Handshake. Graduate students should consult their individual graduate schools for assistance. Can I apply for more than one position? Yes, you can, and should, apply for multiple student employment positions, because jobs are very competitive. Start applying, and don’t stop until you are hired! What if I don’t see a position I like on Handshake? Fall positions are posted during the summer, and spring positions are posted in December and January. However, jobs are approved on a rolling basis throughout the year, so check frequently to see whether new opportunities have been posted that might interest you. Positions are competitive and can fill quickly once interviews begin, so don’t wait too long–or be too choosy–and risk missing your opportunity to apply. Once I apply for a position, how soon will I hear back? It varies greatly depending on the position because so many departments handle hiring differently. Some review applications as soon as the job is posted, while others wait until a job expires. If you are a final candidate for a position, a hiring manager will contact you to schedule an interview. If you are concerned about not hearing about positions, please email oncampusemployment@clarku.edu or make an appointment using “On-Campus Job Search” as the appointment type. If I’m hired, how many hours per week would I work? The required hours for on-campus jobs vary. The posted job description always lists the number of hours. During the semester, U.S. students can work up to 25 hours per week; international students can work up to 20 hours per week. Starting the first full week after exams end and through the final full week before classes start, students can work up to 40 hours per week (inclusive of all positions on campus). How do I update my direct deposit/banking information? To update your direct deposit information, please use our secure direct deposit upload portal for banking information. You will be required to provide proof of your banking account and routing number. To do this you can upload a bank statement or a screenshot from your banking app. Please make sure the image includes your full account number. Does the Office of Student Employment have a secure drop box for submitting updated employment documents (e.g. tax forms, SSN cards, etc.)? We do! Please submit any documents that include Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to our secure upload portal. This information should never be sent via email.

If you are rehiring a student, you do not need to post the position on Handshake, but you must submit a hiring form. I need to hire more student staff in my department. What would I need to do to prepare the job description and get it on Handshake? Please review our “Hire a Student” page. The job description is yours to write! We encourage you to include the approximate number of hours the students will be working per week, if you are willing to train, and general requirements and duties the student(s) would be completing while at work. Anything that may help ensure clarity for potential student employees is great to include (location, desired skills, etc.). Once you submit the position on Handshake, we will review it and approve it or reach out with any concerns. Your department’s past job postings will be in the departmental account. Feel free to duplicate an old post and update it! I submitted a job on Handshake. When will it be live so students can begin applying? All positions submitted to Handshake are reviewed by the Office of Student Employment prior to posting. Please allow 1-3 business days for us to approve the post. This will be extended if we need to reach out to you for additional information. Be sure to include all necessary information upon submission to help expedite the process! I’m hiring for several positions and want to advertise these openings. What is the best way to do that? Generally, the posting department will do the bulk of the advertising work through their own social media accounts, email lists, and students. Please tag @clarku_student_employment on Instagram and we will help spread the word! The information on my company profile on Handshake is way out of date. How do I make edits? Your account owner can make edits; if you are unsure who your account owner is, just email oncampusemployment@clarku.edu and we will tell you! Handshake has helpful articles on this topic too. Hiring Questions I’m hiring a student for a short, project-based assignment (less than 5 business days). How do I hire them? The University allows for payment via One-Time Pay forms. This allows students to complete short-term work without completing a timesheet. Students must still be paid at last the Massachusetts minimum wage of $15 for their work. Students must still be onboarded before completing this work to ensure the University remains in compliance with Federal Labor Laws. When completing hire forms, what start date and end date should I be using? It is preferred that you hire a student through the entire academic year if you think they will be working for you through the year (first day of classes of Fall semester – Commencement). It is much easier for us to cancel a job early than to extend one! My student resigned/was terminated/is studying aboard this semester and will not be working until the end date I had initially indicated on the hire form. What do I do? Please send an email to oncampusemployment@clarku.edu informing us of their last day of employment. This will allow us to update the job record and remove any future timesheets. If this position needs to be filled, please post the job on Handshake and begin the hiring process. If the student was terminated, please let oncampusemployment@clarku.edu know! Some of my students currently working for me want to return next semester. What do I do to re-hire them? If students currently work for you and they will be returning, please submit an Interview Exchange previously employed hire form. Students who have already worked on campus will not need to complete onboarding again. I hired a student who hasn’t worked on-campus before. How long will it take to get them approved? All employees on the University (students, faculty, and staff), must be properly onboarded according to Federal Labor Laws prior to their first day of work for pay. Employees must complete necessary tax documentation as well as complete a United States Citizen and Immigration Services I-9 form that requires in-person identity verification. If a student did not bring proper identification with them to campus, this can cause delays in the onboarding process. Once you have hired a student, we ask that you send them the hired student flyer that helps explain the onboarding process. We will also reach out to new hires who need to onboard once we have received a hire form from you. I recently hired an international student who needs to apply for a social security number (SSN). What steps are required of hiring managers? In order for an international student to acquire an SSN, they must receive an offer letter from the hiring department signed by the hiring manager. There is a template listed on our Hire a Student page. Please be sure the student countersigns the offer letter before going to the Social Security Administration Office. Please review the Student Employment Handbook appendix that explains the process of hiring students and explains that international students can work and be paid without an SSN on file for up to 30 days after their hire date. When should I use the External Grant Payroll Authorization Form? Anytime a student’s position is funded by an external grant, please use the External Grant Payroll Authorization Form on Interview Exchange. All external grants start with 23XXX, 24XXX, 25XXX, or 2 followed by a letter. Interview Exchange Will Handshake still be used for job postings? Yes, please post all positions on Handshake; nothing about this part of the process has changed. How do I know if I need to use a budget approver? This varies department by department. Please check in with your supervisor or department administrator to determine if budget approval is required. I’m submitting a hire form for a different department that is not showing up on my Department list. How can I add this org number to my account? Please contact oncampusemployment@clarku.edu to edit your account permissions. How can I get an account to submit an Interview Exchange hire form? Please contact oncampusemployment@clarku.edu to be added to Interview Exchange. How do I delete a hire form? If you have not submitted a hire form for approval, please select the trash can to delete the form. If you have submitted a hire form for approval, edit the hire form’s name to include “CLOSED.” Then select “Close Form” on the top right of the forms page and enter your reason for closing the form. For students in the union, where do I indicate the leave report approver? Leave report approvers vary by department. Please contact oncampusemployment@clarku.edu with any questions. How do I know when a student is approved to work? Once a student has been approved to work, the form requestor will receive an email “Form Completed – Student’s Name – Position Name.” The hire form will also move to the “Completed Forms” box on your Interview Exchange dashboard. I’m hiring several students with identical job information. Is there a way to copy hire forms? Yes! Please check out page 17 of our Interview Exchange Hire Form instructions. How do I edit a hire form that I have submitted? From the forms page, hit the “Actions” button on the right side and select “Mark as Incomplete.” Hit the “Actions” button again and select “Republish.” From there, you should be able to edit and resubmit the form. We have instructions available on making edits here! What’s the difference between a “previously employed” and “new” hire form? If a student has worked at Clark University before (with you or in another position) and has completed the required onboarding paperwork, they are a “previously employed” student. If a student has never worked on campus and needs to complete onboarding with the Office of Student Employment, please submit a “new” hire form. Please contact oncampusemployment@clarku.edu if you need assistance determining if your new hire has worked on campus before! Policies What is the Massachusetts minimum wage? All student employees must be paid at least the Massachusetts minimum wage of $15 an hour, effective January 1, 2023. How many hours per week can students work? During the semester, U.S. students can work up to 25 hours per week; international students can work up to 20 hours per week. Starting the first full week after exams end and through the final full week before classes start, students can work up to 40 hours per week (inclusive of all positions on campus). When is the last day students can work? The day of commencement is the last day that undergraduate and graduate students can work. After that, summer employment begins. This year, commencement is May 19, 2025 (or December 30, 2024 for Fall graduates). Can students work remotely? Remote work is allowed only within the state of Massachusetts. If you would like to hire a student to work remotely outside of Massachusetts during the summer break, you will need approval before doing so. Remote work is never allowed outside of the United States. Email oncampusemployment@clarku.edu to begin the approval process with Financial Services and Human Resources. What is the pay rate for graduate students? The rate for non-union students is more about how specialized the work is and how much training is needed rather than which school year the student is. If the job requires a lot of training and/or experience, the rate is usually $16/$17 per hour. What do I need to know about federal work study (FWS)? Federal work study is given to some students in their financial aid package, and it is money they can earn if they find a job (as opposed to money that is applied to their bill). Whether a student has FWS does not impact your student wage budget. We ask that hiring managers give priority to students with FWS so that Clark can meet obligations to the federal government for the work study program.

A nightly feed will update the student’s account. Timeline: List of PhD students due to GSAS around July 1 and November 1. This needs to be done at least 2 weeks before bills go out (generally bills go out mid-July for fall; for spring, generally mid-November). It is also acceptable to send the list of students earlier than this timeline! Health Care Subsidy Per the CBA, all Graduate Assistants in doctoral programs on nine (9) month stipends performing unit work will be covered by the University student plan at a 100% subsidy. Departments should typically send a list of students who are eligible for 100% of the health care subsidy to the Assistant Dean of Graduate Studies, who will then enter the exemption code in the student’s account in Banner. A nightly feed will update the student’s account. If a student who is eligible for the health care subsidy and previously waived it has a qualifying event and needs to opt into health care coverage, they can contact Chris Bostek in Student Accounts. Chris will then direct them to University Health Plans to fill out the Qualifying Event form at info@univhealthplans.com. Timeline: List of PhD students on stipends due to GSAS around July 1 and November 1. This needs to be done at least 2 weeks before bills go out (generally bills go out mid-July for fall; for spring, generally mid-November). Employed Student Lists Provided to Union Stewards Departments should provide a list of masters and PhD students who will be employed for the new academic year to their assigned union steward. It is understood that this is a tentative list. Union stewards will reach out to new employees to educate them about the union and to obtain a membership card for the union. Timeline: The list should be sent by July 1 to the union steward for each department where feasible. Again, it is understood that this is a tentative list. A final list of all union employees will be handled directly between the Payroll Office and the Teamsters early in the semester. Graduate Union for Faculty/StaffGraduate Union for Students Hiring Documentation for Graduate Student Union Appointment Letters and Personnel Files As noted in Article 10, if feasible, and except for students in a masters program, the University will endeavor to notify Graduate Assistants of their appointment at least one (1) month before the start of the semester in which their appointment begins. The University will endeavor to provide appointments for masters students as soon as they are known. Timeline: Typically 8/1 (fall) and 12/15 (spring) for appointments (i.e., funding) (admission letter can serve as the appointment letter) Typically 8/15 (fall) and 1/1 (spring) for assignments (specific job assigned); for summer, 14 days before work begins All appointment and assignment letters and contracts for union positions must be shared with the Office of Student Employment per Article 13 (email them to oncampusemployment@clarku.edu). Compensation Compensation information is in Article 16 of the CBA. It stipulates at least a 2% increase, which for AY 24-25 will be a stipend of $29,719 for all departments except for the English department, which will be $12,400. The hourly rate is $19.96 for AY 24-25. The Office of Student Employment will confirm the percentage increase for each new academic year to union departments each year, typically in June, after consulting with Human Resources. Instructor of Record Assignments For students who do not have 9-month appointments but are hired to teach a course, the CBA does not specify a rate of pay beyond being compensated at a rate no lower than the hourly rate, which increases each year ($19.96 for AY 24-25), and the Instructor of Record Pay ($1,500 per course) (reference Article 16). The pay will be $5,500 plus the $1,500 instructor of record pay, for a total of $7,000 for a 1-unit course. Hire Forms Hiring information should be submitted to the Office of Student Employment. Process information is on our Hire a Student page; the TA/RA spreadsheet should continue to be used and should be emailed to oncampusemployment@clarku.edu. Other union positions (including work funded by external grants) must be submitted via Interview Exchange. Leave approvers will be designated by department. It is preferable to submit hiring information for the entire year; if assignments change from semester to semester, that does not affect the job record information unless the pay changes (e.g., if a student is working as a TA one semester and teaching a course the next semester). It is easier to terminate a position early than to create a new job record. Instructor of Record Hiring Process Chief Budget Officer sends spreadsheet of approved funds for PT faculty for courses to departments. The departments hire PT faculty (which can include doctoral students), and the department administrator populates a PT faculty spreadsheet that goes to the Provost’s Office listing the course being taught and the instructor teaching the course. The Provost’s Office sends the student their contract, copying department chair and department administrator; students return their contract to the Provost’s Office. The department administrator submits an Interview Exchange hire form to the Office of Student Employment. Instructors of Record are paid via 8 pay periods because they are not entered until after add/drop. Pay Dates and Start of Employment Considerations For PhD students on salaried assignments, the pay is divided into 9.5 pays per semester with a break in between semesters. The first pay for fall is 8/23/24 and the first pay for spring is 1/4/25. Timeline: Hire forms due to the Office of Student Employment no later than 8/1 (fall) and 12/1 (spring); for summer, hire forms are due 14 days before work begins. Note about international students The timing of when a new international student can work is related to when they arrive in the US and can apply for a Social Security Number (SSN). New international student staff should be provided with the guidelines on how to apply for an SSN. Students must secure and present an SSN in order to remain employed at Clark, per our Student Employment Verification Policy included in the Student Employment Handbook.

Union dues will be taken out of union employee paychecks (along with taxes). There is a Canvas site created for union student employees; the stewards add union employees to the site. Stewards advocate for union student employees in a variety of ways. Questions on union eligibility, rights, dues, and other matters should be addressed to your union steward.

Pay Cycles Students are paid biweekly; the payroll dates are available on the Payroll Calendar and Schedule. For PhD students with salaried assignments, the pay is divided into 9.5 paychecks per semester. The first pay of each semester is a half pay due to the start date being in the middle of a pay cycle (8/23/24 and 1/4/25). If a student has a 9-month appointment, there will be a break in pay between semesters. Leave Reports Graduate assistants on salaried appointments must submit monthly leave reports by the last day of each month of work. (Please note that students in hourly positions do not submit leave reports.) Instructions for submitting leave reports are here. If an employee misses a scheduled shift, that counts as a day of leave.

Title: Graduate Student Union - Graduate Arts and Sciences
Content: Graduate Student Union - Graduate Arts and Sciences Skip to content Clark University Graduate Arts and Sciences Toggle main menu Enter a search query. Submit Search Query Enter a search query. Submit Search Query Graduate Student Union Home Graduate Student Union Collective Bargaining Agreement Starting October 12, 2022, a collective bargaining agreement between Clark University and Teamsters Local 170 has governed the terms of employment for master’s and doctoral students in Graduate Arts and Sciences. Under the union contract, these students are called graduate assistants. Read the contract FAQs We have put together the following FAQs to explain who is eligible to join the union and to provide information about how you may be impacted. We will periodically update these FAQs as other common questions arise. We recommend that all students who are eligible for membership read the entire contract, which includes more detailed information. Am I covered by this contract? Generally, masters’ and doctoral students who are serving as teaching assistants (TAs), research assistants, and course assistants in Graduate Arts and Sciences (including International Development, Community, and Environment) are covered by the collective bargaining agreement. Students who are not engaging in instructional or academic research services are not part of the bargaining unit and therefore not covered by the agreement. The definition of eligibility is specified in the contract, as follows: Ph.D. and masters students enrolled and working in the Graduate Arts and Sciences and International Development, Community, and Environment (IDCE) programs who are employed to provide instructional or research services, including teaching assistants, graduate instructors, part-time instructors, graduate teaching assistants, graduate research assistants, course assistants, research assistants and researchers. Excluding undergraduate students, post-baccalaureate students who work or provide services outside of Graduate Arts and Sciences and International Development, Community, and Environment (IDCE) programs, all other faculty, lab assistants, office clericals, managers, and guards and supervisors as defined in the National Labor Relations Act. I am a T.A. this semester, but not next semester. Will I still be covered by the contract even when I have no assignments? No. This contract covers you only in the semesters when you are assigned assistantships. How does the contract affect my compensation? Compensation rates for doctoral stipends and wages for hourly work performed by eligible students are set by the contract for three years. Article 16 of the contract offers the details. Do I have to join the union if I am eligible? Unions set rules regarding membership internally. Questions on union eligibility, rights, dues, and other matters should be addressed to your union representative. Please note that the collective bargaining agreement between the University and the Teamsters Local 170 provides that as a condition of employment for Graduate Assistants. Graduate Assistants in Arts & Sciences (including IDCE) shall either become union members and pay the union dues, or in lieu of becoming a union member, pay the union agency fees. Do I need to pay union dues? If you choose to join the union, dues will be required. Those who choose not to join will be charged an agency fee that covers the cost of union representation. Please consult the Teamsters Local 170 with questions. Is research for my course work and dissertation considered work covered by the contract? Any activities for your course work and dissertation is considered academic work to fulfill your degree requirements, as opposed to wage work that is performed on behalf of the institution. The contract therefore does not cover work conducted for your progress toward degree completion. Why is the contract silent about tuition remission? Tuition remission is a financial award by the university to contribute to your academic work toward completion of your degree. As such it is considered academic, not an aspect of wage labor that is governed by the contract. Can I be hired as a graduate assistant and receive stipends if I am not in good academic standing in my program? No, the condition of offer of work is contingent on your good academic standing. You need to maintain good academic standing to be considered eligible for Graduate Assistantships. Do I get a health insurance subsidy as part of the benefits for the work I do for the university? Doctoral students who are on 9-month appointments performing work specified under the CBA and who elect to choose Student Health Insurance Plan are eligible for 100% health insurance subsidy. Those doctoral students who are on one-semester appointments and hourly appointments are not eligible for subsidy, but can still purchase health insurance through the University. Where can I learn more information? We recommend that all eligible students to review the entire contract. Those who have additional questions can contact their school or union representative.
