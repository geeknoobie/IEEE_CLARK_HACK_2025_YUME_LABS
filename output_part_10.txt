ct, Confirmation of Investigator’s agreement to the management plan, How the management plan will be monitored to ensure compliance, and Sub-recipient Monitoring The University must take reasonable steps to ensure that sub—recipient Investigators comply with the funders’ FCOI requirements. Sub—recipients must make a written assurance that their FCOI policy complies with funders’ regulations. In the case of PHS funded projects, if the sub—recipient cannot certify they have an FCOI policy that is consistent with PHS regulations, they will be subject to the University’s FCOI policy. Written agreements with sub—recipients must establish whether the FCOI policy of the awardee institution or the sub—recipient will apply. In the case of NIH funded projects the awardee institution is responsible for reporting all identified FCOIs for sub-recipient investigators to NIH through eRA Commons.

The committee developed Clark’s current IP policy which was reviewed by faculty governance, including the Steering Committee in spring 2015. Three open fora for faculty, staff and students were also held in the spring semester to discuss the main new and changing areas being addressed in the new policy. The policy was reviewed and approved by senior leadership prior to its adoption effective September 1, 2015. *NOTE: In 2024, a similar planning process is underway to review and revise the current IP policy.

The following outlines the notifications and approvals necessary to make such changes, both internally and with the funder. First and foremost, Principal Investigators should always follow the guidelines in the relevant sponsor’s guidelines. Any request for changes to an award should be made as soon as possible once you are aware of the need, and no later than the date limitations outlined in the University’s or the sponsor’s guidelines. During an award, a Principal Investigator (PI) may want to make changes to the budget or to modify other aspects of the project. In some cases, the changes may require only internal approval by the University and in other cases such changes may require approval of the sponsor prior to the change. Re-budgeting and Prior Approvals procedures vary from sponsoring agency to sponsoring agency and it is the responsibility of the PI to review and be familiar with the procedures of their project sponsor (including non-government sponsors). Below constitutes some general rules. As policies do vary from sponsor to sponsor and are amended from time to time, PIs are ultimately responsible for being familiar with their sponsor’s requirements at the time the award is made. When do I need prior approval? General Guidelines for Changes Requiring Prior Approval Most sponsors will require obtaining their approval prior to the following changes: Change in the objectives or scope of the project “Significant” re-budgeting which is often defined as transferring over 25% of the award among direct cost categories Absence of or significant change of PI or other key personnel effort Change of grantee institution Need for additional funding Transfer of a “significant part” of the programmatic effort to a third party Transfer of Participant Support costs to another budget category Application of new technology Change in the approved use of animals or human subjects Pre-award spending more than 90 days prior to the award start date Clark University requires internal approval on the changes listed above in addition to the following budget revisions: Pre-award spending within 90 days of the award start date Re-budgeting which moves funds into salaries/support costs for the PI Procedures Procedures for Review and Approval All re-budgeting and prior approvals requests must: Occur prior to any changes or actions, and Be submitted through OSPR whether they require sponsor approval or internal approval. All requests should be emailed to OSPR with a description of the change requested including a justification for the change. OSPR will advise the PI as to next steps in obtaining approvals. In the case of re-budgeting requests requiring internal approval only, OSPR staff will review and consult with the Dean of Research to make a determination. Once the determination is made, notification will be sent to the PI, and to Grant Accounting if applicable. When sponsor approval is required, OSPR staff will work with the PI to create the request. OSPR will contact the sponsor with the request in most cases, either via email or through the appropriate research administration portal, e.g., Research.gov. Budget Revisions Will be Denied When: Budget revision requests will be denied when: the requested revision does not comply with funder and/or university guidelines, requirements, and/or terms and conditions for allowable expenditures and/or budget revisions. required prior approval from the funder is denied. there is insufficient lead time to process and approve the request per funder guidelines. there is insufficient documentation or justification for the request. the timing of the revision is at such a point in the period of performance that the intended expenditure may not benefit the project to the extent intended by the funder during the award period. Time Extensions Time Extensions All sponsored projects are awarded for a specified time period based on the sponsor’s confidence that the proposed project period is reasonable and consistent with the project objectives. Due to a number of circumstances, there may be a need to request additional time to complete a sponsored project, even if no additional funding is being requested, i.e., No Cost Extension. Similar to budget revisions, sponsor guidelines vary and some requests for time extensions can be approved internally, and others required sponsor approval. All requests for time extensions must be submitted through OSPR whether they require sponsor approval or internal approval. Request for a time extension should be made at least 90 days prior to the end of the approved award period.

It should also be understood that the process below must be appropriate for applications involving persons of any university position where such misconduct may occur. Definitions “Research misconduct” means fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, or other practices that seriously deviate from those that are commonly accepted within the academic community for proposing, conducting, or reporting research. It does not include honest error or honest differences in interpretations or judgments of data. “Falsification of data” – Ranging from fabrication to deceptively selective reporting, including the purposeful omission of conflicting data with the intent to falsify results. “Plagiarism” – Representation of another’s work as one’s own. “Misappropriation of Others’ Ideas” – The unauthorized use of privileged information (such as violation of confidentiality in peer review), however obtained. This behavior is not specifically mentioned in the definition of research misconduct given above, but is generally considered to also constitute such misconduct. Required Training The Responsible and Ethical Conduct of Research (RECR) training is a part of funding requirements for both the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundations (NSF). Clark University subscribes to the CITI Program training resource to provide access to RECR training for faculty, staff, and students. Principal Investigators (PIs) are responsible for not only overseeing and mentoring their students and researchers in the responsible and ethical conduct of research, but also for ensuring that all undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and any researchers supported by their NSF awards have successfully completed the designated modules of the online course. NSF: All PIs, Co-PIs and senior personnel named on NSF proposals submitted on or after July 31, 2023, and undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researcher supported on NSF awards must complete RECR training (NSF 23-1). Faculty and senior personnel should complete training within 60 days of the receipt of funding. Undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate researchers should complete training within 60 days of salaries being charged to an account. In July 2023, NSF expanded the required training topics to include data management and mentorship. For proposals submitted on or after July 31, 2023, PIs, Co-PIs, and senior personnel named on resulting award, and postdocs, undergraduates, and graduates charging salary to the award must complete a refresher course with the updated modules. NIH: NIH requires that all trainees, fellows, participants, and scholars receiving support through any NIH training, career development award (individual or institutional), research education grant, and dissertation research grant must receive instruction in responsible conduct of research. In 2022, NIH issued updated guidance (NOT-OD-22-055) on the format, frequency, and timing of RCR instruction as well as additional topics for consideration. This policy applies to any NIH-funded programs supporting research training, career development, or research education that require instruction in responsible conduct of research as stated in the relevant funding opportunity announcements. Process for Addressing Research Misconduct Allegations The specific procedures for dealing with allegations of misconduct in research at Clark University are adapted from the Association of American Universities (AAU) framework and follow the steps below: An inquiry to determine whether the allegation or related issues warrant further investigation, When warranted, an investigation to collect and thoroughly examine evidence, A formal finding, and Appropriate disposition of the matter. Inquiry Allegations should be taken to the Dean of Research (DoR). The claimant(s) is a party who is filing the inquiry, and respondent(s) is a party against whom the inquiry is filed. The inquiry is initiated by an allegation/complaint involving the possibility of misconduct, and conducted by the DoR. Scrupulous care must be taken to assure that no one with a conflict of interest (defined in accordance with established University policies as used by the Committee on Conflict of Interest) in the matter at issue sits in a position of judgment.[1] An inquiry is not a formal hearing; it is designed to separate allegations deserving of further investigation from frivolous, unjustified, or clearly mistaken allegations. Allegations that have not been brought in good faith may lead to disciplinary action. The Dean is responsible for notifying the respondent(s) within a reasonable time of the charges and process that will follow. When the inquiry is initiated, the respondent(s) is notified of the obligation to cooperate by providing material necessary to conduct the inquiry. During the inquiry, confidentiality is desirable in order to protect the rights of all parties involved to the extent possible. The completion of an inquiry is marked by a determination of whether or not an investigation is warranted. The Dean is to develop a report summarizing the process and stating the conclusion of the inquiry, and inform the claimant(s) and respondent(s) whether or not there will be further investigation. Allegations found to require investigation is forwarded to the investigation panel. Federal regulation requires that the agency sponsoring the research is notified at this point. If an allegation is found to be unsupported but has been submitted in good faith, no further formal action is taken. Allegations submitted in bad faith may result in discipline. Investigation Investigations, if required, shall be conducted by a subcommittee of the Research Board, constituting at least 3 board members representing disciplinary diversity. A member outside of the Research Board, with appropriate scientific expertise, may be added to assure a relevant knowledge base. The purpose of investigation is to explore further the allegations and determine whether fraud/misconduct has been committed. The investigation focuses on accusations as defined previously and examines the factual materials of each case. In the course of an investigation, additional information may emerge that justifies broadening the scope of the investigation beyond the initial allegations. The respondent is informed when new directions of investigation are undertaken. Findings The committee is to submit in writing the findings of the investigation to the Dean, and is advised to do so within 120 days of the start of the investigation. The report is shared with the respondent(s), or parts that are pertinent to his or her role if multiple respondents are involved. All federal agencies, sponsors, or other entities initially informed of the investigation is notified. Findings include evidence to one of the following determination: a finding of fraud; a finding of serious scientific misconduct short of fraud; a finding that no culpable conduct was committed, but serious scientific errors were discovered; or a finding that no fraud, misconduct, or serious scientific error was committed. If misconduct is found, no disciplinary measures is taken against the complainant if the allegations, however incorrect, are found to have been made in good faith, and every effort should be made to prevent retaliatory action against the complainant. If the allegations are found to have been made in bad faith, disciplinary actions may be taken against those responsible. Relevant sections of the Faculty Handbook, student Code of Conduct, and other governing University policy documents should be applied. Appeals of the investigative committee’s decision by the respondent(s) are restricted to the body of evidence already presented, and must be submitted to the Provost in writing within 30 days of the determination. The grounds for appeal are limited to failure to follow appropriate procedures in the investigation or new evidence that had not been considered by the committee. New evidence, however, may warrant a new investigation. The review and decision by the Provost is final. Outcome and Disposition Outcomes and Dispositions of Cases should be determined in accord with procedures and carried out by properly designated bodies within the University. Relevant sections of the Faculty Handbook, student Code of Conduct, and other governing University policy documents should be applied as they are now written for equally grave situations, including rights and procedures for appeal. Thus, for faculty subjects, if any personnel actions are envisioned, the Committee on Personnel would become involved; for students, the proceedings would go to the College Board of Graduate Board. Reporting to the federal agency which is supporting the research, if applicable, must be done in accordance with the federal rules. All investigation reports, attachments, appeals, actions, and findings will be given to ORI (Office of Research Integrity) at the close of the investigation. [1]If conflict of interest exists between the Dean and the claimant(s) or respondent(s), the Provost will designate someone to conduct the inquiry. Responsible Conduct in Research Responsible conduct of research is the practice of scientific investigation with integrity. It involves the awareness and application of established professional norms and ethical principles for all activities related to scientific research.

Training Requirements The following procedures support the RECR Training Requirements that apply to all NSF supported projects* as well as other research conducted at Clark: PIs are responsible for directing all undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers supported by their NSF awards to successfully complete the CITI RCR training course within 60 days of commencing work on the project. The CITI course can be accessed from any computer. New participants will need to create an account by clicking on “Register” under “Create an Account,” then selecting “Clark University” for your organization affiliation, then completing the required registration information. CITI Training Website Under “Select Curriculum” participants will be given five choices: Human Subjects RCR Basic Curriculum (NOTE: this is the required RCR course) RCR Basic Curriculum + Human Subjects (NOTE: this is the required IRB course) RCR Basic Curriculum + Animal Subjects RCR Basic Curriculum + Human and Animal Subjects NOTE: NSF RECR Requirement * For NSF awards: You MUST take the RECR Refresher Course if you previously completed RECR (or RCR) training before July 1, 2023. The refresher course includes modules on mentorship and data management, which were not available prior to July 2023. All courses include a “refresher course.” It is recommended that you take a refresher course if you have completed any of the required courses within the last three (3) years. After three (3) years, it is recommended that you complete the full course requirement. If Human Subjects and/or Animal Subjects are NOT a part of a your NSF-sponsored work, you should select the RECR Basic Curriculum. If Human Subjects and/or Animal Subjects ARE a part of your NSF-sponsored work, you should choose the curriculum that includes the relevant material(s). National Science Foundation Policy NSF Policy (as of July 23, 2023) All grant applications to NSF must certify that the institution has a plan, “to provide appropriate training and oversight in the responsible and ethical conduct of research to undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers who will be supported by NSF to conduct research.” It is expected that all researchers at Clark University carry out their work according to the highest ethical and professional standards. The responsible and ethical conduct of research (RECR) is critical for research integrity, especially the professional standards expected of researchers. Responsible and Ethical Conduct of Research Training is a framework for conveying these standards, and an important component of scholarly and career development. NSF RECR Training Requirement All Principal Investigators, Co-PIs and senior personnel named on NSF proposals submitted on or after July 31, 2023, and undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researcher supported on NSF awards must complete RECR training (NSF 23-1). Faculty and senior personnel should complete training within 60 days of the receipt of funding. Undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate researchers should complete training within 60 days of salaries being charged to an account. In July 2023, NSF expanded the required training topics to include data management and mentorship. For proposals submitted on or after July 31, 2023, PIs, Co-PIs, and senior personnel named on resulting award, and postdocs, undergraduates, and graduates charging salary to the award must complete a refresher course with the updated modules. Principal Investigators are responsible for not only overseeing and mentoring their students and researchers in the responsible and ethical conduct of research, but also for ensuring that all undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers supported by their NSF awards are successfully completing the designated modules of the online course. Procedures for completing required modules Once participants have completed their registration and course selection, they will be required to complete course modules and pass quizzes in the following RECR core areas: research misconduct, data acquisition/management/ownership, publication practices and responsible authorship, peer review, mentor and trainee responsibilities, conflict of interest, collaborative research, data management and mentorship – in addition to human subjects and/or animal subjects were applicable. Optional case studies on the required material are available during the online course. Successful completion of the course is estimated to take between four and six hours. The course does not need to be completed in one sitting. Participants may log out at any point and return at a later time to complete the course. OSPR will receive confirmation of the participant’s successful completion of the course directly from CITI. PIs should also maintain a record of their students’/researchers’ successful completion of the training. Please do not hesitate to contact OSPR with any questions on the RECR requirement, the CITI program, or any of the above procedures. NIH Policy on Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) and FCOI NIH requires that all trainees, fellows, participants, and scholars receiving support through any NIH training, career development award (individual or institutional), research education grant, and dissertation research grant must receive instruction in responsible conduct of research. This policy also applies to any other NIH-funded programs supporting research training, career development, or research education that require instruction in responsible conduct of research as stated in the relevant funding opportunity announcements. The purpose of the NIH Update on the Requirement for Instruction in the Responsible Conduct of Research is to update the agency’s policy on instruction in the responsible conduct of research, to convey some of the consensus best practices that have evolved in the research training community over the past two decades, and to provide access to additional information that may be useful to institutions and individuals in meeting their obligations under NIH policy.

Home IRB/Human Subjects What is Human Subjects Research? Activities that meet the federal definition of ‘human subjects’ under 45 CFR 46.102(e) and ‘research’ under 45 CFR 46.102(l) require IRB review and approval, or a formal determination that the project is exempt. The IRB is responsible for determining whether activities and projects meet these definitions and when or whether IRB review and approval is required. These determinations are made by the IRB Chair or by another IRB member designated by the Chair. All research involving human subjects that meets the criteria set forth in 45 CFR 46.102, irrespective of funding and/or funding source, conducted at Clark University and/or by any Clark University faculty, staff, or student (full-time/part-time status and/or undergraduate/graduate level), must be reviewed by the IRB. No human subjects research may commence until the IRB has reviewed and approved the protocol and issued a written notice of approval or exemption. There is no provision in federal regulations that allows for IRB approval of non-exempt research that has already been conducted. The IRB applies two definitions of research depending on the type of project under consideration. If a project meets at least one of these definitions it is considered to be research for purposes of IRB review. The first definition is most commonly applicable to research conducted at Clark University. Definition 1: Research Research is defined as a systematic investigation, including research development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. Learn more here. Systematic Investigation A detailed or careful examination that has or involves a prospectively identified approach to the activity based on a system, method, or plan. Systematic investigations ordinarily Attempt to answer research questions (for example, a hypothesis), Are methodologically driven (data/information are collected in an organized and consistent manner), Draw conclusions from the results. Generalizable Knowledge The information is expected to expand the knowledge base of a scientific discipline or other scholarly field of study and yield one or both of the following: Results that are applicable to a larger population beyond the site of data collection or the specific subjects studied. Results that are intended to be used to develop, test, or support theories, principles, and statements of relationships, or to inform policy beyond the project. Definition 2: Research Conditions The activity is Research if both of the following conditions are met: The intent of the activity is to develop information about a drug, medical device (including diagnostic tests), or biologic substance for submission to the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and The activity involves the prospective physical use of drug, medical device (including diagnostic tests), or biologic substance, in a way that is not completely up to the discretion of a clinical practitioner. Activities Not Defined as Research Learn More The following activities are NOT defined as research, following §46.102(l): Scholarly and journalistic activities (e.g., oral history, journalism, biography, literary criticism, legal research, and historical scholarship), including the collection and use of information, that focus directly on the specific individuals about whom the information is collected. Note that in some cases activities of this type (e.g., oral history or journalism) might include components that qualify as human subjects research under 45 CFR 46. Hence, researchers are strongly encouraged to contact the IRB before engaging in these activities to avoid inadvertent violations. Additional guidance on this topic may be found here. [1] Public health surveillance activities, including the collection and testing of information or biospecimens, conducted, supported, requested, ordered, required, or authorized by a public health authority. Such activities are limited to those necessary to allow a public health authority to identify, monitor, assess, or investigate potential public health signals, onsets of disease outbreaks, or conditions of public health importance (including trends, signals, risk factors, patterns in diseases, or increases in injuries from using consumer products). Such activities include those associated with providing timely situational awareness and priority setting during the course of an event or crisis that threatens public health (including natural or man-made disasters). Collection and analysis of information, biospecimens, or records by or for a criminal justice agency for activities authorized by law or court order solely for criminal justice or criminal investigative purposes. Authorized operational activities (as determined by each agency) in support of intelligence, homeland security, defense, or other national security missions. Human Subject Definition Human Subject means a living individual about whom an investigator conducting research obtains data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or identifiable private information, following §46.102(e). Intervention includes both physical procedures by which data are gathered (for example, venipuncture) and manipulations of the subject or the subject’s environment that are performed for research purposes. Interaction includes communication or interpersonal contact between investigator and subject. Private information includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information which has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and which the individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (for example, a medical record). Private information must be individually identifiable (i.e., the identity of the subject is or may readily be ascertained by the investigator or associated with the information) in order for obtaining the information to constitute research involving human subjects. To be “human subject research” under 46.102(e), a study must be entirely or partly “about whom,” as opposed to being solely “about what.” If the study is wholly “about what,” it is not human subject research. For example, asking a bank manager to provide information on how many loans were made by a bank during the prior year would not constitute human subjects research. Common Examples at Clark University Some Additional Examples Commonly Encountered at Clark University: Given the above definitions, the following are NOT considered to be human subjects research for purposes of IRB review requirements. Internal data collection conducted by Clark University (or faculty, staff, students) solely for non-research purposes (following the definitions above), such as data collected solely for internal program improvement or to inform institutional strategic planning, with no other research uses. Situations in which the institution solely permits use of its facilities to investigators from other institutions (with no other involvement of Clark personnel in the research) or when its employees or students participate as subjects in research conducted by individuals at other institutions. Interactions with individuals solely for purposes of obtaining methodological advice on how to conduct a project (i.e., “about what”), where these individuals are not subjects of the project (they do not provide study data). For example, asking an expert for guidance on how to use a microscope for a chemistry project does not constitute human subjects research. [1] As described by OHRP guidelines, “the objective of the activities in this category is to provide an accurate and evidence-based portrayal of the individuals involved, and not to develop generalizable knowledge. In some cases, these activities can be designed to affect those individuals’ reputations, and to deliberately expose the individuals to public scrutiny or even possible harm, such as losing their positions or employment. The human subject protection regulations were not intended to cover individuals who are the focus of such scholarly and journalistic activities. Consequently, the protections afforded by 45 CFR 46, including the requirement that risks to subjects be minimized, are inappropriate for these activities. For example, a journalist or a biographer might collect and present factual information to support their presentation of the character of an individual to show that the individual does not deserve the positive reputation he or she enjoys in society. Such fields of inquiry generally have their own codes of ethics. In contrast, if the activity involves collecting and using information about individuals for the purpose of drawing generalizations about such individuals or a population of which they are members, then the activity does not fit the parameters of this exception, and the activity may fall within the 2018 Requirements’ definition of “research.” What is Human Subjects Research?Human Subjects PolicyCITI TrainingIRB Proposal ApplicationIRB Meetings and DeadlinesAnonymous vs. ConfidentialCourse ApprovalExempt ApprovalContinuing ReviewExample Forms and ProtocolsFaculty Advisor ResponsibilitiesResearch Participation System Contact Information Sponsored Programs and Research Office Location Jefferson 5th Floor, AtwoodClark University950 Main StreetWorcester, MA 01610 Lisa Gaudette, Director 1-508-421-3835 lgaudette@clarku.edu Quick Links Grants & Contracts IRB/Human Subjects Funding Opportunities Procedures & Policies Forms & Agreements Apply Undergrad Apply Grad Give Contact Us Helpful Links Helpful Links Report a Concern Campus Safety Events Offices Employment Website Feedback Follow Us See more of us on Facebook See more of us on Twitter See more of us on Instagram See more of us on TikTok See more of us on YouTube See more of us on LinkedIn See more of us on Threads Return to Clark University Homepage Challenge Convention.

The IRB is responsible for protecting the rights and welfare of individuals who serve as subjects of research. All research involving human subjects should follow the safeguards established by the University for such work and on file with OSPR. IRB Review and Approval IRB approval (or a formal indication that research is exempt) must be obtained before research activities may begin. To obtain approval or exemption, an application with the IRB must be filed. The IRB conducts different levels of review, depending on the type of research activities and subjects that are involved. Expedited reviews may be conducted for certain types of minimal risk research, as permitted by federal guidelines (45 CFR Part 46). Other reviews must be conducted by the convened IRB at a regular meeting. The IRB will determine what type of review is applicable to each submitted protocol. Approval for some projects must be renewed annually; others do not require annual review. Your approval letter will indicate whether annual continuing reviews are required. Where annual review is required, continuing review forms are due in the IRB office (humansubjects@clarku.edu) at least 45 days prior to protocol expiration (typically one year after the approval date). These are submitted via the Mentor IRB website. If a continuing review form to extend approval for ongoing research is not received by the deadline, the approval will expire and research must cease. Procedures to obtain a reliance agreement with IRBs of other institutions is located here: Reliance Agreements with IRBs of Other Institutions Policy and Procedures IRB approval is an institutional permission to conduct research. It is not an agreement for the university to provide data on Clark students, staff, or faculty (including contact information) for recruiting human subjects. Please also note that the university will not assist in disseminating surveys or interview requests using university email addresses. Recruitment of subjects must be conducted by the principal investigator through other means. The names of current members of Clark’s IRB may be obtained from the Office of Sponsored Programs. Questions concerning protocols for the protection of human subjects should be addressed to the Office of Sponsored Programs. Regulations & Procedures Safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects involved in research and training at Clark University, or off campus with funds administered by Clark University, is the responsibility of the institution. The Public Health Service policy states that no grant, award, or contract for the support of research involving human participants shall be made unless the research is given initial and continuing review (where required) and approval by an appropriate committee of the applicant institution. Clark University’s IRB operates under an assurance agreement with the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Under this agreement, the IRB reviews all human subjects research to ensure that the rights and safety of subjects are protected. Following 45 CFR Part 46, in order to approve research subject to IRB oversight, the IRB shall determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied: Risks to subjects are minimized: By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk, and Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes. Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (e.g., the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility. Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons. Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and to the extent required by, §46.116. Informed consent will be appropriately documented or appropriately waived in accordance with §46.117. When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects. When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. Mentor IRB Procedures Proposal application guidelines, deadlines and forms are found on the Mentor IRB website. Upon receipt and review of a completed proposal, the IRB may take various actions, including (1) approval, (2) granting an exemption from further IRB review (3) request for major or minor revisions, or (4) rejection. Investigators must retain consent forms (or other documentation of consent, as relevant) and other research records for a minimum of three years following the date of protocol approval. Investigators who wish to change a previously approved protocol must submit a formal request for amendment (or modification) to the IRB. Amendment requests should be submitted using the Mentor IRB website, select the “Amendments” tab at the bottom of the protocol page. Investigators may only implement changes to approved research prior to IRB review and approval, if the changes are necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject (45 CFR 46.108(a)(3)(iii) under the 2018 Requirements and 45 CFR 46.103(b)(4)(iii) under the pre-2018 Requirements). Investigators on approved IRB proposals must notify the IRB chair immediately of: Any unanticipated problems that occur during the research and affect subject welfare (adverse events), and Any deviations from the approved protocol (whether intentional or unintentional). These reports are also submitted via the Mentor IRB website by choosing the “Adverse Events” or “Protocol Deviations” tab at the bottom of the protocol page. The IRB is only responsible for reviewing human subjects research to ensure the rights and welfare of subjects, as described under 45 CFR 46. Other questions regarding research conduct and ethics should be directed to the Office for Sponsored Programs and Research.

IRB Proposal Application Review and Approval All IRB applications and amendment requests must be submitted through the Mentor IRB website. This website provides instructions and forms for all types of IRB applications and requests. IRB approval (or a formal indication that research is exempt) must be obtained before research activities may begin. To obtain approval or exemption, an application with the IRB must be filed. The IRB conducts different levels of review, depending on the type of research activities and subjects that are involved. Expedited reviews may be conducted for certain types of minimal risk research, as permitted by federal guidelines (45 CFR part 46). Other reviews must be conducted by the convened IRB at a regular meeting. The IRB will determine what type of review is applicable to each submitted protocol. If you wish to alter your research methods for an already-approved protocol, you must submit an amendment request to the IRB. These requests will be subject to either expedited or full-board review. Some types of work with human subjects may not be considered “research” according to federal guidelines and may not require IRB review. If you have questions regarding whether your research requires review, please contact humansubjects@clarku.edu. If in doubt, please assume the IRB review is required. The Anonymous Survey Application can only be used for anonymous surveys. Data are anonymous if no one, including the researcher, can connect the data to the individual who provided it. All other research types require the standard IRB Proposal Application. IRB Proposal Procedures Proposal Determination Process If a project meets the definitions of human subjects research described above, it must be submitted to the IRB using the Mentor IRB system for review following standard IRB Proposal Procedures. If a project involves human subjects and/or human subjects data but the investigator believes that it might not meet the definition of human subjects research, the IRB must determine if it qualifies as “human subjects research” and thereby requires IRB review. Investigators collecting human subjects data for research purposes cannot “self-exempt” (declare their own project as “Not Human Subject Research”). If there is any possibility that a project might be human subjects research, the IRB must be consulted to determine if the project requires review. To receive an official determination of whether a project is human subjects research, investigators should complete a protocol application using the Mentor IRB system. Mentor includes a set of path-dependent questions that allow the IRB to determine whether a project involves human subjects research and what type of review is required. Protocol submissions for “not human subjects research” determinations follow the same general procedures as other submissions in Mentor. However, responses to the full set of possible protocol application questions are not required for projects that do not meet the criteria for human subjects research. In such cases, Mentor only asks a limited set of path-dependent questions necessary for the IRB to make this determination. In addition, CITI training is not required prior to submitting a determination application of this type. If the project is determined to involve human subjects research, CITI training must be completed before the project is reviewed by the IRB. Upon receipt of the protocol submission in Mentor, the IRB Coordinator assigns the protocol to the IRB Chair for categorization, following IRB Proposal Procedures. As part of the initial categorization review, the Chair determines whether the project includes human subjects research. If the project is determined not to include human subjects research, a determination of “not human subjects research” will be made within Mentor. The IRB Coordinator then sends a formal notification of this determination to the investigator through Mentor. No further IRB review or approval is required. If the project is determined to include human subjects research, it is categorized by the Chair for further review and approval (or exemption) by the IRB, following standard IRB Proposal Procedures. Prior to this review, the investigator will be asked to complete any additional protocol sections in Mentor necessary to complete the IRB review, as a protocol revision request. Informal inquiries into whether IRB review and approval may be needed do not require submission of a protocol within Mentor. Informal inquiries may be directed to the IRB Office or Chair, who will provide guidance on whether a Mentor protocol submission is required. The IRB will retain records of these informal inquiries and their disposition.

Complete proposal applications must be submitted by the relevant deadline for each meeting. Applications that can be reviewed on a rolling basis (e.g., exempt and some expedited reviews, including anonymous surveys) can be submitted at any time. Apart from situations in which urgent review is required due to extenuating circumstances, the IRB does not review new applications during the summer. Deadlines and meetings for the current and following academic year are as follows: Fall Semester 2024: Deadline DateMeeting Date September 13, 2024 at 5:00 pmSeptember 27, 2024October 11, 2024 at 5:00 pmOctober 25, 2024November 8, 2024 at 5 pmNovember 22, 2024December 6, 2024 at 5 pmDecember 20, 2024 Spring Semester 2025: Deadline DateMeeting Date January 10, 2025 at 5 pmJanuary 24, 2025February 7, 2025 at 5 pmFebruary 21, 2025March 14, 2025 at 5 pmMarch 28, 2025April 11, 2025 at 5 pmApril 25, 2025May 9, 2025 at 5 pmMay 23, 2025May 30, 2025 at 5 pm *June 6, 2025* *NOTE: The May 30th deadline for the June 6th meeting, the IRB will not be accepting new applications. Important Information: If research is to start in the summer months or in September, please have your applications submitted by the April meeting deadline. This will insure the proposal will have enough time for revisions and approval. Turnaround time for proposal review is normally 1-3 weeks after submission (for exempt or expedited reviews) or 1-2 weeks after the meeting date (for full board reviews). An additional week is sometimes needed for special circumstances. Some committee determinations may require review of a revised proposal at a subsequent meeting of the full committee. It is strongly urged that research planned for summer be submitted for review NO LATER THAN APRIL to allow time for resubmission if required. All IRB applications must be submitted using the Mentor IRB website. Use the Mentor IRB link for IRB proposal applications and instructions. The Clark IRB requires that informed consent documents given to subjects participating in non-exempt research bear the approval stamp of the IRB. The stamped document is the only consent form that may be photocopied for distribution to study participants.

They have distinct meanings and it is important for an investigator to understand the difference when developing their research study and submitting a protocol to the IRB. When conducting human subjects research, the level of risk to which subjects are exposed is an important consideration that the IRB must consider in the course of its review. It is the investigator’s responsibility to minimize the potential for harm to research subjects. The distinction between anonymous and confidential data relates to this level of risk to subjects, and the investigator must clearly define the activity as anonymous or confidential in their IRB application. No one activity or type of data can ever be both anonymous and confidential (though, a single research study may utilize numerous activities, or methods of data collection, some of which yield anonymous data and some of which yield confidential data). How to Submit Application for an Anonymous Survey If the survey is anonymous, it is eligible for expedited review and may be submitted via the abbreviated anonymous survey application in Mentor. Expedited reviews for anonymous surveys are conducted on a rolling basis; you do not need to wait for a regular IRB meeting date. Anonymous survey submissions must include: an application and copy of the survey instrument. All forms and instructions for these applications are found on the Mentor IRB website. As part of your anonymous survey application you will be asked how your instrument will be administered. If the survey will be conducted electronically, Clark’s web-based survey software, Qualtrics, must be used. (It is acceptable to use non-Qualtrics software for anonymous surveys, in general. However, those surveys are not eligible for the abbreviated anonymous survey application.) If your methodology requires functionality that is not available in Qualtrics, ITS Staff may assist in evaluating the availability of the feature and alternative survey solutions. When collecting web data there are unique challenges to ensuring respondent anonymity; ITS staff will help ensure Qualtrics is configured in accordance with IRB standard protocol. To determine if Qualtrics will support your research methodology, visit the Survey Support section of the ITS web site. Anonymous Data Anonymous refers to data that can in no way be linked to information that could potentially be used to identify or trace a specific subject. When an investigator promises anonymity, even the investigator cannot link the research data collected with the individual from whom it was collected. Even a reasonable probability that someone could guess the identity of a research subject means that the data are not anonymous. Example: Surveys are often conducted anonymously, particularly when completed online. However, even conducting a survey online does not necessarily guarantee anonymity. Computers have IP (internet protocol) addresses by which a user may be identified. The investigator, therefore, must ensure s/he uses survey software that does not track IP addresses or must turn this tracking off in the survey settings. It is commonly believed that data is anonymous if the investigator has not collected direct identifiers, such as name, Social Security number or student ID number. It should be understood, however, that indirect and demographic variables, such as age, race or sex, could, in some circumstances, be used to identify subjects, particularly when a number of them are being collected together. Therefore, if the investigator finds it necessary for their research to collect specific identifiers, they should collect only the identifiers necessary for the research objectives. In addition, the anonymity of the data may be invalidated due to small sample size and/or a sample that is not diverse. If precautions are not taken, it may be difficult to conceal the identity of the subjects and relatively easy to link the subjects to their data Example: An investigator collects the religious affiliation, sex, grade level and academic major of a sample of 400 students. The sample includes one Christian female freshman philosophy major. Example: An investigator collects the marital status of 50 recent college graduates. The sample includes one widow/widower. Example: An investigator collects the income level (in ranges) of 100 recent high school graduates. The sample includes one graduate earning between $100,000 and $150,000. In all of these cases, the study is not anonymous because the data collected can be linked to specific individuals. Anonymous data collection involves the lowest level of risk or potential for harm to the subjects because it is not possible to determine who provided the data. Confidential Data Confidential refers to private information that a subject discloses with the expectation that it will not be divulged to others without that subject’s permission. When an investigator promises confidentiality, the subject is asked to supply information that could potentially identify that subject, which is then linked to the research data collected from the subject with the understanding that the investigator will not disclose the information to others outside of those for whom the subject has given the investigator explicit consent to share (i.e., the research team). Example: Surveys and interviews conducted in-person are considered confidential rather than anonymous, as the investigator can identify the subjects, even if the investigator has collected no other identifying information. It is important to note the use of the terms divulge and disclose, as they point to an important aspect of confidentiality that the investigator must always keep in mind — that privacy cannot be guaranteed. While the investigator may promise not to share the subjects’ private information, it may still be discoverable by outside parties. When dealing with confidential information, then, the investigator must ensure the information is collected and stored in such a way as to minimize discovery by outside parties. Example: One-to-one interviews that are conducted in a public place may be overheard by others. Example: The investigator stores identifiable data on their computer unencrypted. The computer is left unattended and found by an outside party who traces the data to the subjects. Confidential data collection involves a higher level of risk or potential for harm to the subjects than does anonymous data collection. It should be noted that there are multiple levels of possible risk in confidential data collection and storage. Example: The fewer the number of individuals who have access to the data, the lower the level of risk. Focus groups involve a higher level of risk than do one-to-one interviews, as the subjects must rely on the ability of all other subjects as well as the investigator to maintain the confidentiality of the information shared. Example: The more securely the data is stored, the lower the level of risk. Encrypted computers are more secure than locked file cabinets, and encrypted servers are more secure than personal computers. Protecting Confidentiality Prior to a subject’s participation in research, they must be told whether their involvement and the data collected will be anonymous or confidential. If the data are to remain confidential, it is also important for the investigator to discuss with the subject during the process of informed consent the level of confidentiality that can be offered and the potential for breach of confidentiality. This should, as well, be noted on the informed consent form. Note that there are times when breaking confidentiality may be required. Investigators who are mandated reporters, for example, must disclose to subjects that they are legally obligated to report suspected child or elder abuse, or if the participant or others are in immediate risk of harm. Possibilities of this type must be noted in the consent form, as applicable to each project. An important consideration in the use of confidential data is the investigator’s responsibility to keep the data as safe and secure as possible. The investigator can do this in a variety of ways (note the following list is in no way exhaustive): Limit access to the data to as few individuals as possible. Code the data whenever feasible. Store hard copies of the data in locked cabinets in locked rooms. Store the data, master code list and informed consent forms in separate locations. Transfer (from person to person, place to place) the data (field notes, recorded interviews, informed consent forms) promptly and securely. Transcribe recorded data as soon as possible and destroy original recordings. Store data on an encrypted computer or server. Upload data to an encrypted server promptly (do not wait until all data is collected). Delete identifiers (or de-identify) as soon as is feasible. It is imperative that investigators keep in mind at all times the potential harm (social, legal, economic, physical) to subjects that may result from a breach in confidentiality. Plans for data security must be outlined in the research protocol when discussing the provisions for managing risk, and approved by the IRB. Coded Data A common practice for reducing the risk of a breach of confidentiality is for the investigator to code the information and data collected from the subject. When data is coded, a subject’s identifying information is separated from the subject’s research data and replaced with a code. The investigator then keeps a “master list” of the subjects’ names and identifying codes. For security purposes, the master list is kept separately from the subjects’ data. Example: Studies that involve interviews often utilize pseudonyms to mask subjects’ identities. In such cases, the investigator assigns each subject with a code name, which is used in all interview notes in lieu of the subject’s name. A master list linking the subjects’ names to their pseudonyms is developed to keep track of the data and is secured in a locked file cabinet. The interview notes are secured separately on an encrypted server. De-identification Another common practice — one that often leads to confusion between anonymous and confidential — is for the investigator (or the individual/organization from which the data originates) to de-identify the data collected from the subject. De-identification is the process by which all links between the subjects’ personally identifying information and their research data are severed and the investigator has no code by which to re-identify them. Data that will be de-identified is considered confidential data, because the researcher is able to identify the subjects prior to de-identification. Example: Often when an investigator conducts secondary data analysis, all identifying information has been scrubbed from the data prior to the investigator receiving it. (Note that in this case, the individual/organization from whence the data originated may retain the identifying information with the data.) Example: An investigator removes all identifying information from their research data and maintains no code with which to re-identify the data. It is important to remember that the more indirect identifiers investigators collect, the higher the risk of re-identification. In addition, the investigator must keep in mind that there may be information available on the subjects that are unconnected from the data collected for the specific research in question and cumulatively, this information may be used to re-identify the subjects.

Qualtrics has been reviewed by Information Technology Services and Institutional Review Board and it is in accordance with the Clark Appropriate Use and Data Security Policies. Please note: research surveys require the approval of Clark’s IRB prior to launching a survey and contacting participants. This tool is best used for: Research surveys Surveys requiring extensive data manipulation Projects with external parties such as alumni or vendors Microsoft Forms Microsoft Forms is a web-based survey tool included within Clark Office 365 accounts. With this tool, users can create simple, flexible forms and surveys. Information is easily exported to Excel and responses can be reviewed in real time with automatically generated graphics. This tool has not yet been reviewed for research purposes, but it is ideal for internal projects or polls. Currently, Microsoft Forms supports the following question types: multiple choice, text entry, matrix table, rank order, rating 1-5, Net Promoter Score, and file upload. Please note: the file upload option will only be available to respondents within the Clark community. This tool is best used for: Registration or RSVP forms Informal quizzes Internal feedback and information gathering Surveys completed on mobile devices Frequently Asked Questions Which tool should I use? The tool you use depends upon your project’s needs. Use the guiding questions below or contact the technology training specialist to determine which software is best suited for your survey. Who is the audience for this survey? What is the purpose of this survey? What device will participates use to respond? Am I comfortable building my own data report? Is this form or survey time-sensitive or ongoing? Where can I find support for Microsoft Forms? Click here to contact Clark University’s technology training specialist Click here to view a LinkedIn Learning playlist on Microsoft Forms Please note: you must activate your free LinkedIn Learning account prior to viewing this playlist Where can I find support for Qualtrics? Clark University subscribes to Qualtrics support, which allows all members of the Clark community to get help from Qualtrics directly. Qualtrics Support offers extensive videos, how-to guides, and survey best practices on their website (Qualtrics Support) and their YouTube Channel. Additionally, you can log in to chat, email or talk to a representative over the phone. Click here to visit the Qualtrics Support portal Select the Sign in with SSO option Enter “clarku” for the organization-ID How do I design a good survey instrument? Well designed surveys can minimize complexity for participants and other sources of error. The resources below provide more information about constructing effective survey questions and minimizing measurement error: Survey Questions 101: Do You Make any of These 7 Question Writing Mistakes? The 10 Commandments For Writing Outstanding Survey Questions Keep up with theoretical and methodological advances with the journal: Public Opinion Quarterly What software do I need to use Qualtrics or Microsoft Forms? Both Qualtrics and Microsoft Forms are web-based. All you need is web browser and an internet connection. Though not a requirement, it is best practice to develop a survey instrument in a text editor before creating a web survey. Does my survey require IRB approval? Clark University is committed to ensuring that all human subjects research is conducted in accordance with the basic ethical principles widely adopted by professional societies and as prescribed in federal regulations. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Office of Sponsored Programs and Research (OSPR) at Clark must approve of research methods through an application and review process prior to any contact with potential subjects. For more information, visit the Sponsored Programs and Research IRB website. My grant sponsors want to know if Qualtrics is safe for my participants and secure for my data. What should I tell them? Qualtrics Survey software is vendor hosted web service. It is installed on a public web server and hosts surveys that are public facing. Data is stored in a secured database and can be accessed only by authorized Clark University domain users (eg. faculty staff and students). Qualtrics is role and permission based, therefore only a researcher, and specified designees, can access a survey and the associated response data. Through a combination of software controls and standard practice, safe guards are in place to protect the safety of the survey participants: Qualtrics has the capacity to anonymize responses, this ensures that a participant’s IP address is not retained in the software database. Details about the security, reliability, and availability of data in Qualtrics are summarized in the linked pages: Qualtrics & GDPR Compliance Qualtrics Security & Compliance Survey controls exist to prevent cookies from being planted on a participant’s browser. This can minimize the possibility of a domestic partner, family member, or other computer user seeing a participant’s response. Researchers using the system agree to follow a standard protocol established by the Clark University IRB to ensure the overall safety of survey participants. As a IT industry standard practice, web servers have the capacity to — and do — log IP addresses of incoming internet traffic. All Clark Information Technology Staff operate under a confidentiality agreement. In addition, only IT staff with proper training have access to such logs. Finally, ITS staff do not make it a practice to view web server logs. login to qualtrics login to microsoft forms Contact Information ITS Help Desk Office Location 1-508-793-7745 helpdesk@clarku.edu Academic Commons, Plaza Level Check Systems Status Spring 2025 hours Mon – Thurs: 8 am – 12 am Fri: 8 am – 5 pm Sat: 12 pm – 5 pm Sun: 12 pm – 12 am Apply Undergrad Apply Grad Give Contact Us Helpful Links Helpful Links Report a Concern Campus Safety Events Offices Employment Website Feedback Follow Us See more of us on Facebook See more of us on Twitter See more of us on Instagram See more of us on TikTok See more of us on YouTube See more of us on LinkedIn See more of us on Threads Return to Clark University Homepage Challenge Convention.
