The University seeks to prepare students to meet the challenges of a complex and rapidly changing society. In students and faculty, Clark fosters a commitment to excellence in studying traditional academic disciplines, as well as innovation in exploring questions that cross disciplinary boundaries. The free pursuit of inquiry and the free exchange of ideas are central to that commitment. The focus of Clark’s academic program is a liberal-arts education enriched by interactions among undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty, and is closely linked to a select number of professional programs. Clark also serves students who wish to continue formal education throughout their lives. The intellectual and personal growth of students is enhanced by a wide variety of educational programs and extracurricular activities. Clark believes that intellectual growth must be accompanied by the development of values, the cultivation of responsible independence, and the appreciation of a range of perspectives. Clark’s academic community has long been distinguished by the pursuit of scientific inquiry and humanistic studies, enlivened by a concern for significant social issues. Among many other scholarly endeavors, Clark contributes to understanding human development, assessing relationships between people and the environment, and managing risk in a technological society. Clark is dedicated to being a dynamic community of learners able to thrive in today’s increasingly interrelated societies. The University maintains a national and international character, attracting high-caliber students and faculty from all quarters of the globe. As a university residing in an urban context, Clark also strives to address the needs and opportunities of contemporary urban life. Clark’s intimate academic setting and tradition of “elbow teaching” provide many opportunities for students to pursue knowledge through participation. High expectations, as well as easy access to the scholar-teacher faculty, encourage students to become autonomous learners. Clark’s international and interdisciplinary orientation is combined with a tradition of strong self-direction among students and faculty. These attributes enhance the University’s ability to contribute to the development of new modes of thought and to the advancement of society through the creation and transmission of knowledge.

He later gave a signed copy to Esther Goddard, the physicist’s widow, who donated the book to Clark’s library. Freud’s only lectures outside EuropeSigmund Freud presented his Clark lectures in 1909 as part of a series of conferences held in observance of the University’s 20th anniversary. It would be Freud’s only visit to America, and his only lectures outside of Europe.

We cultivate and nurture relationships with regional, national, and international media outlets to share the accomplishments, insights, and scholarship of the Clark community. We can help faculty publicize research, honors, and achievements, including books or articles published in esteemed journals. We also work with members of the Clark community to author, edit, and place op-eds, and publicize campus events.

Media Resources Expert Sources Clark’s Rankings and Recognition Clark University at a Glance History of Clark University How We Help the Media Media Relations staff will be available to help you with the following and more: Locate and access interview sources such as Faculty Experts Arrange use of appropriate spaces, lighting, backdrops, props, etc. Find clear directions and help with parking arrangements Collect background information or official comment needed for accurate and balanced reporting. The safety, privacy, and unimpeded academic and extracurricular pursuits of Clark students, faculty, and staff are priorities. Residence halls and classrooms/labs are off-limits without prior arrangement through the Media Relations office. Commercial production companies and non-news related media are required to contact University Marketing and Communications before conducting business on campus. In the event of an emergency, the University administration and/or law enforcement or fire personnel can close the campus or areas on campus to the public, including members of media. In such a crisis, staff will work to arrange off-site or alternative ways to provide media outlets with accurate and up-to-date information. FOR FACULTYShare Your Expertise Why be a faculty expert? Serving as a resource for the media helps raise your profile and gives you an opportunity to plug your scholarship and/or funded research. Reporters are always looking for experts on a variety of topics to interview for their stories, and Clark’s Media Relations team is eager to promote the wide-ranging expertise of our faculty. We have tip sheets and best practices, so don’t be shy. Contact us today if you’re curious. We’d love for you to be part of the national conversation. How to work with Media Relations Clark’s Media Relations team has enjoyed great success publicizing Clark faculty news and our professors’ analysis of breaking news to high-profile journalists. Our team welcomes the opportunity to connect Clark experts to reporters who write for national and international media outlets on a variety of topics ranging from the effects of climate change on the Earth’s oceans to emerging adults’ views on love and marriage. If you expect news to break on a topic you follow, send us a brief (three to four sentences) analysis of the situation, a prediction about how events might unfold, or a pithy/controversial comment for us to share with the media as soon as possible after news breaks, and we’ll “pitch” your comment to interested journalists and encourage interviews. Because we are a small shop, we encourage you to contact us quickly and provide as much lead time as possible if you are interested in serving as a resource for the media; contact by email is usually best. The sooner you let us know about your forthcoming book or journal article, conference participation or presentation to lawmakers, the more prepared we will be to publicize your news in real-time. Thinking about setting up a blog or interested in learning more about social media? Contact us. Faculty who share their expertise with the press elevate the University’s reputation and help promote Clark to prospective students and their families worldwide. Alumni and friends of the University also report an added sense of pride when they see Clark faculty quoted in newspapers and in online outlets, or hear a Clark expert interviewed on the radio or on TV. The Media Relations staff is constantly reviewing queries from daily from hundreds of reporters looking to connect with faculty experts (typically on a tight deadline). If we discover a media opportunity that might be a match for your expertise, we present you with the opportunity to offer a comment, and at the same time try to be mindful of your busy schedule and classroom commitments.

Our existing behavioral health care system for adolescents and young adults is fragmented and lacks continuity of care among schools/communities/families, as well as coordination of services in the systems of education/foster care/substance abuse/juvenile justice/vocational development. Rising rates of suicide, especially among black youth Globally, depression is one of the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents, with suicide now the third leading cause of death in 15-19-year-olds. 6 In the U.S., suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people aged 15 to 24. 7 Among Americans aged 10 to 24, the suicide rate increased 25% from 2017 to 2019. 8 Among all U.S. youth ages 10 to 24, suicidal thoughts and plans dropped between 1991 and 2017, but among black youth, suicidal attempts increased by 73%. 9 Pervasive structural inequities and social determinants of health, including racism, poverty, violence, education, housing, employment and nutrition, may be driving these numbers for youth of color. https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/adolescent-mental-health Kessler RC, Angermeyer M, Anthony JC, et al.

Young Americans need to be engaged in and empowered through a re-imagined behavioral health system designed to serve all youth. Youth-led initiatives backed by strong youth/adult partnerships must lead the way. Evidence shows that comprehensive Social Emotional Learning approaches—in and out of school—work. They: Improve young people’s mental health, attitudes about self, others and school Create a more positive classroom environment Generate an 11% gain on standardized achievement tests Result in fewer conduct problems, less emotional stress and reduced drug use An SEL approach helps adults as well, with results showing: Teachers who possess SEL competencies stay in the classroom longer because they can work more effectively with challenging students —one of the main causes of burnout. Significant links between SEL skills in kindergarten and young adult outcomes across areas of education, employment, criminal activity, substance use and mental health. Technology holds enormous potential through innovative apps that provide low-cost, efficient, 24/7 behavioral health care navigation, self-help support and skill-training, diagnostics tools, and guidance on community resources. Community-based involvement is essential as providers grounded in communities can connect and collaborate to address disparities in behavioral health care across multiple systems of juvenile justice, foster care, substance abuse and education. For youth of color, greater investment is needed in: 1) suicide prevention and intervention strategies tailored to the needs of black children and teens; 2) improved access and availability of mental health services; 3) a more diverse workforce contributing to mental health services and research; and, 4) a better understanding of persistent racial disparities in youth suicide.

Problem Solution Action News and Events Info For Who We Are What We Do Our Focus Problem Solution Action News and Events From Our BlogRe-opening schools calls for a high bar February 5, 2021 By Aaron D. Haddock, Ph.D. and Nadia L. Ward, Ph.D. As we move toward re-opening schools, we must carefully consider how best to do so. We’ve been in uncharted waters for nearly a year, simply doing our best to adjust to an unfamiliar, unpredictable, and ever-evolving state of affairs. Understandably, much of the focus has been on the logistics of remote learning, and when and how to safely re-open schools. Equally important, however, is the need to reflect on what youth, families, and teachers have been through emotionally and to prepare to meet their needs. The pandemic has caused high levels of stress, fear, sadness, and anxiety for many people for myriad reasons: concerns about physical health, loss of loved ones, job loss or financial stress, and social isolation. And due to long-standing systemic health and social inequities, communities of color have been hit the hardest. Schools must, therefore, prepare now to address a range of concerns. Students may experience separation difficulties or resistance to returning to school. Youth with pre-existing behavioral health problems and those with a prior history of trauma or loss warrant special consideration. Families may also be facing loss of income, food and/or housing insecurity. Those students subjected to ongoing racial inequities will need additional support and assistance. Educational professionals must make appropriate adjustments to ensure school is not a source of further distress for students. Helping students feel physically and psychologically safe needs to become our first priority. More than ever, the cultivation of trauma-sensitive school environments will be essential. A trauma-sensitive school is a place where “all students feel safe, welcomed and supported and where addressing trauma’s impact on learning on a school-wide basis is at the center of its educational mission” (Cole, Eisner, Gregory, & Ristuccia, 2013). Educators need training to identify and support students affected by trauma and toxic stress. The following tips can help. Here’s What You May Observe Youth impacted by highly stressful and traumatic events can experience a range of difficulties. They may: Struggle to communicate their needs and ask for help. Have difficulty managing strong emotions, such as anger and irritability. Find it challenging to comply with reasonable requests, understand the impact of their behavior on others, and engage in problem solving. Have low self-esteem or self-worth and find it hard to form healthy relationships with caregivers and peers. Here’s What You Can Do We must keep in mind that youth are strongly influenced by how they see important adults in their lives cope with challenges. When we manage our emotions effectively we’re better able to model healthy behavior, and help youth feel secure and optimistic. To best support and reassure youth in our care, we must bring awareness to our body language, the words we choose, and the intensity of emotions we express. Consistently practicing strategies that promote calm, perspective, and balance can aid in this. It is important to listen, empathize, and let youth know most reactions are normal, and to be there to help them manage big emotions, calm down, and regain control. Make space for youth and staff to talk about their feelings and share their experiences during the pandemic, without forcing discussion or interviewing for negative feelings. Keep in mind that kids process events like kids, and will often do so through play rather than words. Don’t assume you know how others, and particularly youth, are feeling or why they’re feeling that way. Ask, hold space for one another, and allow the people in your life to cope and feel in different ways. Understand your own limits. When you feel overwhelmed and nothing you’ve tried seems to be working, you may need to seek the support of a professional. That’s okay. Trauma-informed and trauma-sensitive school environments will be essential for successful re-entry by students and educators. We will continue to blog to contribute our experience and advice on the “how” of safely re-opening schools. Aaron D.

Clark is anchored by a core of arts and sciences departments that include everything from biology to visual and performing arts. Atop this foundation, Clark adds the innovative transdisciplinary Department of Sustainability and Social Justice, which brings together faculty and students from multiple disciplines — all working to develop solutions to world challenges. Two additional schools complete our academic enterprise: the Graduate School of Business, which offers an undergraduate major and several master’s degrees, and the School of Professional Studies, which offers degrees and certificates for working professionals. Schools Undergraduate Arts and Sciences Clark’s undergraduate program in the arts and sciences provides an innovative liberal arts bachelor’s degree combining rigorous coursework with hands-on experiences that enable students to apply their knowledge to solve problems beyond the classroom. We call this Clark Core. Regardless of the discipline, Clark takes its students on a journey from theory to practice, classroom to the world. Clark students graduate with deeper critical thinking skills, a deeper understanding of other cultures and perspectives, and new ways of seeing and appreciating the natural world. Learn More Graduate Arts and Sciences As the first institution in the United States initially dedicated exclusively to graduate training and research, Clark University offers doctoral programs that have championed intellectual inquiry since the University’s founding in 1887. Today, Clark offers doctoral programs in biology, biochemistry, chemistry, economics, geography, history, physics, and psychology, and an M.A. in English and a master of arts in teaching (MAT). Clark’s division of Graduate Arts and Sciences flourishes as a close-knit community of more than 225 scholars in nine Ph.D. programs and two M.A. programs. Clark’s doctoral program in geography is top-ranked, and we have awarded more Ph.D.s in geography than any other institution. Our doctoral program in psychology is famous for its emphasis on culture and the social determinants of human well-being. And our unique program in Holocaust and Genocide Studies brings students from different disciplines together to study — and help prevent the reoccurrence of — some of humankind’s worst history. Our MAT program is nationally recognized for its success in strengthening educational outcomes in urban schools. In addition, Clark offers 14 accelerated degree programs that allow students to add a master’s degree onto their bachelor’s degree with only one additional year of work — and with free tuition for eligible students. Learn More Becker School of Design & Technology Featuring one of the world’s top five Game Design programs and top 10 Master of Fine Arts programs per The Princeton Review, the Becker School of Design & Technology provides students with a real-world studio environment to prepare them for lifelong careers in an exciting, rapidly changing industry. We also offer an accelerated master’s program, allowing students to obtain a B.A. in Interactive Media Design, then add a fifth year to pursue the MFA.
